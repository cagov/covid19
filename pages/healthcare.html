<p><strong>I want to get screened or tested for COVID-19. I have insurance, but what will this cost me out-of-pocket?</strong></p>



<p>It should be free. The state agencies that regulate health care in California have mandated that all full-service insurance plans (including Medi-Cal) waive copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles for medically necessary screening and testing for COVID-19. This includes emergency room, urgent care, or provider office visits when the purpose of the visit is to be screened and tested for COVID-19.</p>



<p><strong>I have a concern or complaint about getting care for COVID-19 under my health insurance. What can I do?</strong></p>



<p>If you are having trouble accessing care, or were inappropriately charged cost-sharing for medically necessary screening and testing for COVID-19, follow up directly with your health plan by calling the member phone number listed on your health plan card. If your health plan doesn&#8217;t resolve the issue, contact the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.HealthHelp.ca.gov">California Department of Managed Health </a><a href="https://github.com/cagov/covid19/issues/www.HealthHelp.ca.gov">Care</a>&nbsp;(DMCH) Help Center for assistance at 1-888-466-2219.</p>
