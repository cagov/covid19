<h2><strong>Let’s All Work Together to Keep Our California Communities Healthy</strong></h2>



<p>The state is mobilizing at every level to proactively and aggressively protect the health and well-being of Californians, but we cannot fight this outbreak alone. We need the participation and support of every Californian. That is why we’re providing recent, relevant and reliable information. Californians need to know how to stay healthy and where they can get help. These actions are critical and there is no doubt our collective efforts&nbsp; save lives. </p>



<p><strong>Help get the word out.</strong> Please share videos and social media messages about state and local resources available to support the health, safety, and well-being of all Californians. We are all in this together.</p>
