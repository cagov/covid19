<h2 id="questions">Questions and answers</h2>



<p><strong>Will families still have access to free or reduced meals if their schools close?</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/03/13/governor-newsom-signs-executive-order-ensuring-state-funding-for-schools-even-in-event-of-physical-closure/">governor’s executive order</a> ensures public schools will retain full funding. <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/schooldirectory">Check your local school district</a> for more information on how and where to receive services, including school meals.</p>



<p><strong>How will students with disabilities receive services during school closures?</strong></p>



<p>If a school keeps teaching during a physical closure (by moving classes online, for example), the school must ensure students with disabilities have equal access to the same opportunities. <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/policy/speced/guid/idea/memosdcltrs/qa-covid-19-03-12-2020.pdf">More information</a> is available via the Department of Education.</p>

<p>There are protocols if schools close before or during CAASPP and ELPAC testing. The California Department of Education will work with schools and the US Department of Education to facilitate test administration for schools affected.</p>
