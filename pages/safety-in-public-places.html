<p>Many public spaces have closed across California to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. To minimize risk when you need to go out, stay a few paces away from other people and wash your hands frequently.</p>



<p>The White House has released guidelines that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/large-events/index.html" target="_blank">recommend canceling or postponing all in-person events</a> of 10 people or more for the next 15 days. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have also recommended canceling or postponing events of more than 50 people for the next 8 weeks.</p>



<h2 id="questions">Questions and answers</h2>



<p><strong>Are airports and other forms of transportation safe during the spread of COVID-19?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Crowded travel settings, like airports, may increase your risk of exposure to COVID-19. For specific travel considerations, see the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-in-the-us.html">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance on travel in the U.S.</a></p>



<p><strong>Why is everything getting canceled?</strong></p>



<p>Because people can spread this virus even if they never develop symptoms. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/large-events/index.html">recommends canceling or postponing all in-person events</a> of 50 people or more for the next 8 weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The State of California has directed all bars, nightclubs, breweries, and wineries to close, and restaurants to reduce capacity by half. Do not visit long-term care facilities or hospitals except for end-of-life visits.</p>



<p>If you must go out, maintain six feet from other individuals, as possible, at all times. Any contact with other individuals should be preceded and followed by frequent hand washing.</p>



<p><strong>Is it safe for me to go to the DMV and other government offices?</strong></p>



<p>Crowded settings may increase your risk of exposure to COVID-19. If possible, conduct business online, by mail, kiosks,or over the phone. (Find <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/about/dmvanytime">DMV services online</a>.) If you need to go to a government office:</p>



<ul><li>avoid shaking hands</li><li>stay six feet (three paces) away from other people</li><li>avoid touching your face</li><li>wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds</li><li>if soap and water aren’t available, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer</li></ul>



<p><strong>Are there health risks to shopping at grocery stores?</strong></p>



<p>Crowded settings may increase your risk of exposure to COVID-19. When you need to go to the grocery store:</p>



<ul><li>clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces (such as shopping carts)</li><li>stay six feet (three paces) away from other people</li><li>avoid touching your face</li><li>when you get home, wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds</li><li>if soap and water aren’t available, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer</li></ul>



<p>If you are at higher risk of getting very sick (over 65 or with serious medical conditions), try to minimize errands by getting groceries delivered or asking for help from friends or family.</p>



<p><strong>Can I become infected from food?</strong></p>



<p>As far as we know, coronaviruses spread from person to person through respiratory droplets, <strong>not through food or food packaging</strong>. On February 27, 2020 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-supply-chain-update">Fact Statement</a>, which says they are “not aware of any reports at this time of human illnesses that suggest COVID-19 can be transmitted by food or food packaging.” </p>
