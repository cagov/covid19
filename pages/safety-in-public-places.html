<p>Everyone in California is required to stay home except to get food, care for a relative or friend, get necessary health care, or go to an essential job. If you go out, keep at least 6 feet of distance. <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/">Learn more</a>.</p>



<h2 id="questions">Questions and answers</h2>



<p><strong>Are airports and other forms of transportation safe during the spread of COVID-19?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Crowded travel settings, like airports, may increase your risk of exposure to COVID-19. For specific travel considerations, see the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-in-the-us.html">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance on travel in the U.S.</a></p>



<p><strong>Why is everything getting canceled?</strong></p>



<p>Because people can spread this virus even if they never develop symptoms.</p>



<p>The California State Public Health Officer and Director of the California Department of Public Health is <strong>ordering all individuals living in the State of California to stay home or at their place of residence</strong> except as needed to maintain continuity of operation of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cisa.gov/critical-infrastructure-sectors">federal critical infrastructure sectors</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/">Learn more about the details of this order</a>.</p>



<p>If you must go out for essential activities, maintain six feet from other individuals at all times. Any contact with other individuals should be preceded and followed by frequent hand washing.</p>



<p><strong>Is it safe for me to go to the DMV and other government offices?</strong></p>



<p>Crowded settings may increase your risk of exposure to COVID-19. If possible, conduct business online, by mail, kiosks,or over the phone. (Find <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/about/dmvanytime">DMV services online</a>.) If you need to go to a government office:</p>



<ul><li>avoid shaking hands</li><li>stay six feet (three paces) away from other people</li><li>avoid touching your face</li><li>wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds</li><li>if soap and water aren’t available, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer</li></ul>



<p>The DMV is instituting appointment-only service, canceling all behind-the-wheel drive tests for the next 30 days, and suspending extended office hours and Saturday service. Additionally, the DMV has asked law enforcement to exercise discretion for 60 days in their enforcement of drivers license and vehicle registration expiration dates. <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/pubs/newsrel/2020/2020_12">Learn more about DMV changes to service</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Are there health risks to shopping at grocery stores?</strong></p>



<p>Crowded settings may increase your risk of exposure to COVID-19. When you need to go to the grocery store:</p>



<ul><li>clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces (such as shopping carts)</li><li>stay six feet (three paces) away from other people</li><li>avoid touching your face</li><li>when you get home, wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds</li><li>if soap and water aren’t available, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer</li></ul>



<p>If you are at higher risk of getting very sick (over 65 or with serious medical conditions), try to minimize errands by getting groceries delivered or asking for help from friends or family.</p>
