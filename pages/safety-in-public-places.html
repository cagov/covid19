<p>Many public spaces have closed across California to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. To minimize risk when you need to go out, stay a few paces away from other people and wash your hands frequently.<br></p>



<p>Follow California Department of Public Health <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Gathering_Guidance_03.11.20.pdf">guidance about gatherings (pdf)</a> to protect public health.<br></p>



<h2 id="questions">Questions and answers</h2>



<p><strong>Are airports and other forms of transportation safe during the spread of COVID-19?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Crowded travel settings, like airports, may increase your risk of exposure to COVID-19. For specific travel considerations, see the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-in-the-us.html">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance on travel in the U.S.</a><br></p>



<p><strong>Why is everything getting canceled?</strong></p>



<p>The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) has determined that gatherings should be postponed or canceled across the state until at least the end of March.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If possible, cancel all gatherings. If a gathering is necessary, it must be limited to less than 250 people. As a general rule, maintain six feet from other individuals, as possible, at all times. Any contact with other individuals should be preceded and followed by frequent hand washing.<br>See <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Gathering_Guidance_03.11.20.pdf">CDPH guidance about gatherings (pdf)</a> and <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/CDPH%20Guidance%20for%20Entertainment%20Venues_ADA%20Compliant_3.13.20.pdf">CDPH guidance for entertainment venues (pdf)</a>.<br></p>



<p><strong>Is it safe for me to go to the DMV and other government offices?</strong></p>



<p>Crowded settings may increase your risk of exposure to COVID-19. If possible, conduct business online or over the phone. If you need to go to a government office:</p>



<ul><li>avoid shaking hands</li><li>stay six feet (three paces) away from other people</li><li>avoid touching your face</li><li>wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds</li><li>if soap and water aren’t available, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer</li></ul>



<p><strong>Are there health risks to shopping at grocery stores?</strong></p>



<p>Crowded settings may increase your risk of exposure to COVID-19. When you need to go to the grocery store:</p>



<ul><li>clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces (such as shopping carts)</li><li>stay six feet (three paces) away from other people</li><li>avoid touching your face</li><li>when you get home, wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds</li><li>if soap and water aren’t available, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer</li></ul>



<p>If you are at higher risk of getting very sick (over 60 or with serious medical conditions), try to minimize errands by getting groceries delivered or asking for help from friends or family.<br></p>



<p><strong>Can I become infected from food?</strong>As far as we know, coronaviruses spread from person to person through respiratory droplets, <strong>not through food or food packaging</strong>. On February 27, 2020 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-supply-chain-update">Fact Statement</a>, which says they are “not aware of any reports at this time of human illnesses that suggest COVID-19 can be transmitted by food or food packaging.”
