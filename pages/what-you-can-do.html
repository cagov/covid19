<h3 id="stay-home"><strong>Stay home if you can</strong></h3>



<p>Reducing social contact can help slow the spread of this coronavirus and keep our communities healthy.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Stay home if</strong> <strong>you have coronavirus symptoms.</strong> </h3>



<h4>Symptoms include:</h4>



<ul><li>feeling like you have a fever</li><li>a new cough</li><li>shortness of breath</li></ul>



<h3><strong>Stay home if</strong> <strong>you may have been exposed to COVID-19.</strong> </h3>



<h4>This includes:</h4>



<ul><li>anyone who has traveled to an <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices">affected country</a> within the last 14 days</li><li>anyone who has been in close contact with a person confirmed to have COVID-19</li></ul>



<h3><strong>Stay home if you’re at higher risk.</strong> </h3>



<ul><li>people over 60 years old</li><li>people with compromised immune systems</li><li>people with serious chronic medical conditions</li></ul>



<p>If you or someone you’re close to is at higher risk, avoid going out and have supplies available to minimize the need for errands.</p>



<p>Stay in contact over the phone or online with loved ones and caregivers. Review additional guidance for <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/High%20Risk%20Populations%20Guidance%20ADA%20Compliant%2003.11.20.pdf">high risk individuals (pdf)</a>.<br></p>



<h3 id="avoid-group-events"><strong>Avoid group events</strong></h3>



<p>People can spread this virus even if they never develop symptoms, so the State of California and many cities and counties are recommending people avoid unnecessary close contact with people outside of their home.<br></p>



<p>The California Department of Public Health recommends <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Gathering_Guidance_03.11.20.pdf">canceling or postponing gatherings (pdf)</a> until at least the end of March.<br></p>



<p>Consider using phones or video conferencing instead of face-to-face meetings. If in-person gatherings are necessary:<br></p>



<ul><li>add distance (6 feet, or 3 paces) between where individuals sit or stand</li><li>add more hand washing stations and restrooms</li><li>avoid direct physical contact (handshakes, holding hands, and hugging)</li></ul>



<p></p>



<h3 id="testing"><strong>Testing and treatment</strong></h3>



<p>Many people are able to recover from COVID-19 at home.<br></p>



<p>If you have coronavirus symptoms and think you need testing, contact your healthcare provider. Local health departments and healthcare providers determine who needs testing and hospitalization on a case-by-case basis. </p>



<p><strong>Seek treatment by calling your doctor for a phone evaluation if</strong>:</p>



<ul><li>you have difficulty breathing (shortness of breath)</li><li>you feel like symptoms (such as fever and cough) are getting worse rapidly</li><li>you are unable to care for symptoms at home</li></ul>



<p>If you don’t have a primary care physician or can’t reach them, contact your <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CCLHO/CDPH%20Document%20Library/LHD_CD_Contact_Info_ADA.pdf">local health department</a>. If you need to go to the hospital, <strong>call ahead</strong> so they can prepare for your arrival. If you need to call 911, tell the 911 operator you’re experiencing coronavirus symptoms so the ambulance provider can prepare to treat you safely.<br></p>



<h4>California is rapidly expanding coronavirus testing. </h4>



<p>During this interim period while testing is expanding, testing is being prioritized for people who:<br></p>



<ul><li><strong>have coronavirus symptoms</strong> <strong>AND</strong></li><li>one of these risk factors:<ul><li>have had contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19, OR</li><li>are healthcare providers or work with vulnerable populations (such as a long term care facility), OR</li><li>traveled to an <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices">affected country</a> in the past 14 days, OR</li><li>are over 60 years old, have a compromised immune system, or have serious chronic medical conditions.</li></ul></li></ul>

California is also working with Verily (a private company) to launch a <a href="https://blog.verily.com/2020/03/verily-in-collaboration-with-california.html">pilot program</a> to expand access to COVID-19 screening and testing for high risk individuals, beginning in the Bay Area.<br></p>
