<h3 id="been-exposed">If you’ve been exposed or have symptoms</h3>
<p><strong>Stay at home if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You feel like you have a fever</li>
<li>You have a new cough&nbsp;</li>
<li>You have traveled to an <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices">area of concern</a> within the last 14 days</li>
<li>You have had close contact with a person confirmed to have COVID-19</li>
</ul>
<p>It is <b>not</b> helpful to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wear a face mask if you aren’t sick and aren’t in a healthcare setting</li>
<li>Go to the doctor if you’re able to manage symptoms at home</li>
<li>Stockpile masks or gloves, which are needed by healthcare providers</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="higher-risk"><b>If you’re at higher risk of illness</b></h3>
<p>Older adults and people with compromised immune systems or serious chronic medical conditions are at higher risk of getting very sick from this new coronavirus. If you or someone you’re close to is at higher risk, stay home as much as possible and have supplies on hand to minimize the need for errands.</p>
<p>Stay in contact over the phone or online with loved ones and caregivers. Review additional guidance for <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/High%20Risk%20Populations%20Guidance%20ADA%20Compliant%2003.11.20.pdf">high risk individuals (pdf)</a>.</p>
<h3 id="testing"><b>Testing and treatment</b></h3>
<p>California is rapidly expanding coronavirus testing. During this interim period while testing is expanding, testing is being prioritized for people who have coronavirus symptoms AND:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are over 60 years old, have a compromised immune system, or have serious chronic medical conditions, OR</li>
<li>Have had contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19, OR</li>
<li>Are healthcare providers or work in a congregate setting with vulnerable populations (such as a long term care facility), OR</li>
<li>Traveled to an <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices">area of concern</a> in the past 14 days.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have coronavirus symptoms but are not in one of those groups, contact your healthcare provider for testing options.</p>
<p>Most people who test positive for COVID-19 don’t need to go to the hospital. Local health departments and healthcare providers determine who needs hospitalization on a case-by-case basis. You may need evaluation if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have difficulty breathing (shortness of breath)</li>
<li>Feel like you&#8217;re getting worse rapidly</li>
<li>Are unable to care for symptoms at home</li>
</ul>
<p>To get evaluated, <b>call your doctor for a phone evaluation first</b>.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you don’t have a primary care physician or can’t reach them, contact your <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CCLHO/CDPH%20Document%20Library/LHD_CD_Contact_Info_ADA.pdf">local health department</a>.</li>
<li>If you need to go to the hospital, call ahead so they can prepare for your arrival.</li>
<li>If you need to call 911, tell the 911 operator you’re experiencing coronavirus symptoms so the ambulance provider can prepare to treat you safely.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="everyone-can-do"><b>What everyone can do</b></h3>
<p>People can spread this virus even if they never develop symptoms. Here’s how everyone can help keep communities healthy.</p>
<h4>Do:</h4>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>Shaking hands.</li>
<li>Touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.</li>
<li>Contact with people who are sick.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gatherings"><b>Cancel or postpone gatherings</b></h3>
<p>The California Department of Public Health recommends <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Gathering_Guidance_03.11.20.pdf">canceling or postponing gatherings (pdf)</a> until at least the end of March.</p>
<p>If gatherings are essential, increase safety by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding distance between where individuals sit or stand around tables.</li>
<li>Adding additional hand washing stations and restrooms.</li>
