<p>Reducing social contact can help slow the spread of this coronavirus and keep our communities healthy. <strong>Staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others.</strong></p>



<p>Everyone in California is required to stay home except to get food, care for a relative or friend, get necessary health care, or go to an essential job. If you go out, keep at least 6 feet of distance. <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/">Learn more</a>.</p>



<h3 id="symptoms-risks"><strong>Know the symptoms and risks</strong></h3>



<p>If you have any symptoms or are at risk, it’s especially important to <strong>stay home and avoid in-person contact</strong> with others.</p>



<h4><strong>Coronavirus symptoms include:</strong></h4>



<ul><li>feeling like you have a fever</li><li>a new cough</li><li>shortness of breath</li></ul>



<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">more information about COVID-19 symptoms</a>.</p>



<h4><strong>You may have been exposed to COVID-19 if:</strong></h4>



<ul><li>you have traveled to an <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices">affected country</a> within the last 14 days</li><li>you have been in close contact with a person confirmed to have COVID-19</li></ul>



<h4><strong>Some people are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, including:</strong></h4>



<ul><li>people over 65 years old</li><li>people with compromised immune systems</li><li>people with serious chronic medical conditions</li></ul>



<p>If you or someone you’re close to is at higher risk, avoid going out and have supplies available to minimize the need for errands.</p>



<p>Stay in contact over the phone or online with loved ones and caregivers. Review <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Self_Isolation_Guidance_03.16.20.pdf">additional guidance for high risk individuals (pdf)</a>.</p>



<h3 id="avoid-group-events"><strong>Avoid gatherings and events</strong></h3>



<p>Everyone in California is required to stay home except to get food, care for a relative or friend, get necessary health care, or go to an essential job. If you go out, keep at least 6 feet of distance. <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/">Learn more</a>.</p>



<h3 id="testing"><strong>Get testing and treatment</strong></h3>



<p>Many people are able to recover from COVID-19 at home.</p>



<p>If you have coronavirus symptoms and think you need testing, contact your healthcare provider. Local health departments and healthcare providers determine who needs testing and hospitalization on a case-by-case basis. </p>



<p><strong>Seek treatment by calling your doctor for a phone evaluation if</strong>:</p>



<ul><li>you have difficulty breathing (shortness of breath)</li><li>you feel like symptoms (such as fever and cough) are getting worse rapidly</li><li>you are unable to care for symptoms at home</li></ul>



<p>If you need to go to the hospital, <strong>call ahead</strong> so they can prepare for your arrival. If you need to call 911, tell the 911 operator you’re experiencing coronavirus symptoms so the ambulance provider can prepare to treat you safely.</p>



<h4>California is expanding coronavirus testing capacity daily. </h4>



<p>During this interim period while testing is expanding, testing is being prioritized for people who:</p>



<ul><li><strong>have coronavirus symptoms</strong> <strong>AND</strong></li><li>have one of these risk factors:<ul><li>have had contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19, OR</li><li>work in a healthcare facility, OR</li><li>are in prison or a first responder, OR</li><li>are over 60 years old, have a compromised immune system, or have serious chronic medical conditions.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>To learn more about testing and treatment, see <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/nCoV2019.aspx">California Department of Public Health Coronavirus Updates</a>.</p>



<p>The California community-based COVID-19 testing program is a state-directed, federally supported program in collaboration with Verily&#8217;s Project Baseline which will expand access to COVID-19 screening and testing for high risk individuals, in certain areas of the state. If you are in <strong>Santa Clara or San Mateo County, or within 50 miles of the city of Riverside,</strong> and want to get tested for COVID-19, you can <a href="https://www.projectbaseline.com/study/covid-19/">complete the screener</a> to see if you qualify for testing through this program. You will need internet access and a Google account.</p>
