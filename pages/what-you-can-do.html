<p>Reducing social contact can help slow the spread of this coronavirus and keep our communities healthy. <strong>Staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others.</strong></p>



<p>Seven California counties (San Francisco, Santa Clara, San Mateo, Marin, Contra Costa, Alameda, and Santa Cruz) have been ordered to shelter in place. Residents in these counties are required to stay home except to get food, care for a relative or friend, get necessary health care, or go to an essential job.</p>



<h3 id="symptoms-risks"><strong>Know the symptoms and risks</strong></h3>



<p>If you have any symptoms or are at risk, it’s especially important to <strong>stay home and avoid in-person contact</strong> with others.</p>



<h4><strong>Coronavirus symptoms include:</strong></h4>



<ul><li>feeling like you have a fever</li><li>a new cough</li><li>shortness of breath</li></ul>



<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">more information about COVID-19 symptoms</a>.</p>



<h4><strong>You may have been exposed to COVID-19 if:</strong></h4>



<ul><li>you have traveled to an <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices">affected country</a> within the last 14 days</li><li>you have been in close contact with a person confirmed to have COVID-19</li></ul>



<h4><strong>Some people are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, including:</strong></h4>



<ul><li>people over 65 years old</li><li>people with compromised immune systems</li><li>people with serious chronic medical conditions</li></ul>



<p>If you or someone you’re close to is at higher risk, avoid going out and have supplies available to minimize the need for errands.</p>



<p>Stay in contact over the phone or online with loved ones and caregivers. Review <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Self_Isolation_Guidance_03.16.20.pdf">additional guidance for high risk individuals (pdf)</a>.</p>



<h3 id="avoid-group-events"><strong>Avoid gatherings and events</strong></h3>



<p>People can spread this virus even if they never develop symptoms. The White House has released guidelines&nbsp;that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/large-events/index.html" target="_blank">recommend canceling or postponing all in-person events</a>&nbsp;of 10 people or more for the next 15 days.</p>



<p>The State of California has directed all bars, nightclubs, breweries, and wineries to close. Restaurants should reduce their capacity by half.</p>



<p>Consider using phones or video conferencing instead of face-to-face meetings. If in-person gatherings are necessary:</p>



<ul><li>add distance (6 feet, or 3 paces) between where individuals sit or stand</li><li>add more hand washing stations and restrooms</li><li>avoid direct physical contact (handshakes, holding hands, and hugging)</li></ul>



<p></p>



<h3 id="testing"><strong>Get testing and treatment</strong></h3>



<p>Many people are able to recover from COVID-19 at home.</p>



<p>If you have coronavirus symptoms and think you need testing, contact your healthcare provider. Local health departments and healthcare providers determine who needs testing and hospitalization on a case-by-case basis. </p>



<p><strong>Seek treatment by calling your doctor for a phone evaluation if</strong>:</p>



<ul><li>you have difficulty breathing (shortness of breath)</li><li>you feel like symptoms (such as fever and cough) are getting worse rapidly</li><li>you are unable to care for symptoms at home</li></ul>



<p>If you need to go to the hospital, <strong>call ahead</strong> so they can prepare for your arrival. If you need to call 911, tell the 911 operator you’re experiencing coronavirus symptoms so the ambulance provider can prepare to treat you safely.</p>



<h4>California is expanding coronavirus testing capacity daily. </h4>



<p>During this interim period while testing is expanding, testing is being prioritized for people who:</p>



<ul><li><strong>have coronavirus symptoms</strong> <strong>AND</strong></li><li>have one of these risk factors:<ul><li>have had contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19, OR</li><li>are healthcare providers or work with vulnerable populations (such as a long term care facility), OR</li><li>traveled to an <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices">affected country</a> in the past 14 days, OR</li><li>are over 60 years old, have a compromised immune system, or have serious chronic medical conditions.</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>California is working with Verily (a private company) to launch a <a href="https://blog.verily.com/2020/03/verily-in-collaboration-with-california.html">pilot program</a> to expand access to COVID-19 screening and testing for high risk individuals, beginning in the Bay Area. If you are in <strong>Santa Clara or San Mateo County</strong> and want to get tested for COVID-19, you can <a href="https://www.projectbaseline.com/study/covid-19/">complete the screener</a> to see if you qualify for testing through this program. You will need internet access and a Google account.</p>
