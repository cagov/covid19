<h2>When to get tested</h2>



<h3>If you have symptoms</h3>



<p>Vaccinated or not, get tested immediately if you’re feeling any <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">COVID-19 symptoms</a>.</p>



<h3>If you were exposed</h3>



<p>Anyone exposed should consider getting tested as soon as possible, even if you have no symptoms.</p>



<p>Test again 5 days after exposure.</p>



<h3>If you go to a high-risk event</h3>



<p>Unvaccinated people should test before and 3-5 days after.</p>



<p>For <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/mega-events/">mega-events</a> of more than 1,000 people, all attendees should test 1 day (antigen test) or 2 days (PCR test) before the event and bring proof of negative results. Children under 2 are exempt from testing.</p>



<h3>If you travel</h3>



<p>Unvaccinated people should test 1-3 days before travel, and 3-5 days after. </p>



<p>Vaccinated or not, anyone entering or re-entering California should test 3-5 days after arrival.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator" id="cost-for-testing"/>



<h2>Cost for testing</h2>



<p><strong>There are no out-of-pocket costs for COVID-19 testing at a testing site.</strong> An <a href="https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/Portals/0/Docs/DO/COVID-TestingFactSheet.pdf">insured person can get a COVID-19 test</a> when needed by any provider, in or out of their health plan network, at no cost. If you’re uninsured, the government pays for your test.</p>



<p>But there are some COVID-19 tests you do have to pay for:</p>



<ul><li>At-home test kits&nbsp;</li><li>Some rapid result tests</li></ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" id="testing-at-work"/>



<h2>Testing at work</h2>



<p>Screening tests are recurring tests of people without symptoms in certain high-risk workplaces. They are meant to detect COVID-19 early and stop transmission.</p>



<p>In general,</p>



<ul><li>Fully-vaccinated individuals do not need screening tests in non-healthcare settings.</li><li>Asymptomatic employees in healthcare settings should still get screening tests. This is true no matter their vaccination status. There are a few exceptions:<ul><li>Facilities may stop routine testing of asymptomatic staff who are fully vaccinated where:<ul><li>More than 70% of residents and more than 70% staff are fully vaccinated in a long-term care facility, or</li><li>More than 70% of staff are fully vaccinated in an acute health care facility.</li></ul></li><li>Facilities may continue routine testing for fully-vaccinated staff with compromised immune systems. Examples are those who have undergone organ transplantation or cancer treatment. These conditions might impact the level of protection provided by COVID-19 vaccine.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>Read CDPH’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Updated-COVID-19-Testing-Guidance.aspx">Updated Testing Guidance</a> for more about workplace screening tests.</p>

<h2>Questions and answers</h2>



<h3 class="wp-accordion">What should I do if I may have been exposed to COVID-19?</h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Depending on your vaccination status and infection history, you may need to <strong>quarantine </strong>(stay home). Read about <a href="/quarantine-and-isolation/#if-you-were-exposed-but-have-no-symptoms">how to quarantine</a>.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Consider getting tested, even if you’re vaccinated. Know your status so you can avoid infecting others. Wear a mask around others until you’re sure you’re not infected.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion">What should I do if I test positive for COVID-19?</h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You will need to <strong>isolate </strong>(stay home and avoid others) until the threat of infecting other people has passed. Read about <a href="/quarantine-and-isolation/#if-you-test-positive-or-have-symptoms">how to isolate</a>.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Notify people you have been in contact with so they can get tested, too. If you’re using CA Notify, <a href="https://canotify.ca.gov/code/">send an exposure notification</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion">Does my health plan have to cover my COVID-19 test at a testing site?&nbsp;</h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. <a href="https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/Portals/0/Docs/DO/APL21-011-NewFederalGuidanceRegardingCOVID-19Testing.pdf">Federal guidance</a> requires health plans to provide testing at no cost to everyone. You do not need to have symptoms or to have been exposed to COVID-19. You do not need to be an “essential worker” to get tested.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">To get tested you can go to any COVID-19 testing provider authorized or licensed by the state. You do not need to go to a provider that is in your health plan’s or health insurer’s provider network. You do not need to get permission from your health plan or health insurer before going to get a COVID-19 test. And you do not need to pay a co-payment for a COVID-19 test.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion">What if I don’t have health insurance and I need COVID-19 testing or care?</h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">For the uninsured, the <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/CovidUninsuredClaim">government pays</a> for all necessary COVID-19 testing and care. Check your symptoms using the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsymptoms-testing%2Findex.html">Symptom Screener</a> or by talking to your doctor.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion">How long does it take for COVID-19 test results to come back?</h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Turnaround time for COVID-19 test results is usually less than two days. About two-thirds come back within a day, and more than 85% are available within two days.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">This turnaround time includes shipping time. For labs that process home testing kits, turnaround time depends on when you mail back your kit.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you haven’t received your test results and it’s been several days, contact:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Your healthcare provider,</li><li>Testing service, or&nbsp;</li><li>Local health department.</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Read more at <a href="https://testing.covid19.ca.gov/">California’s COVID-19 Testing Task Force</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion">What is acceptable as proof of a negative COVID-19 test result?</h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The following are accepted:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Printed document from your test provider or laboratory</li><li>An email or text message displayed on your phone from your test provider or laboratory</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Results should include name of person tested, type of test, and date of negative test result. For PCR, the negative result must be from the last 3 days. For antigen, the negative result must be from the last day.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">A shorter test window is required at <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/mega-events/">mega-events</a> (over 1,000 people). There you must show a negative PCR test result from within the last 2 days, or a negative antigen test result from within the last day. Children under 2 are exempt from testing.</p>
