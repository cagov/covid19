<h2>When to get tested</h2>



<h3>If you have symptoms</h3>



<p>Vaccinated or not, get tested immediately if you’re feeling any <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">COVID-19 symptoms</a>. If an antigen test is negative, take another in 24-48 hours, as early cases can be missed.</p>



<h3>If you were exposed</h3>



<p>Anyone exposed should consider getting tested as soon as possible, even if you have no symptoms.</p>



<p>Test again 5 days after exposure.</p>



<h3>If you go to a high-risk event</h3>



<p>Test before and 3-5 days after.</p>



<p>For <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/mega-events/">mega-events</a> of more than 1,000 people, it&#8217;s strongly recommended to test 1 day (antigen test) or 2 days (PCR test) before the event.</p>



<h3>If you travel</h3>



<p>Test before travel, and 3-5 days after. </p>



<p>Vaccinated or not, anyone entering or re-entering California should test 3-5 days after arrival.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator" id="testing-at-work"/>



<h2>Testing at work</h2>



<p>Screening tests are recurring tests of people without symptoms in certain high-risk workplaces. They help detect COVID-19 early and stop transmission.</p>



<p>In general,</p>



<ul><li>Vaccinated individuals do not need screening tests in non-healthcare settings</li><li>Healthcare settings may have other requirements&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Read CDPH’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Updated-COVID-19-Testing-Guidance.aspx">Updated Testing Guidance</a> for more about workplace screening tests.</p>
