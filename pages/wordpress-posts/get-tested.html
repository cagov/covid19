<h2 id="types-of-tests">Types of tests</h2>



<p>Two types of COVID-19 tests are available: <strong>Diagnostic tests</strong> and <strong>antibody tests.</strong></p>



<p>A <strong>diagnostic test</strong> can show if you have an active coronavirus infection. Currently there are two types of diagnostic tests: viral PCR tests that detect the virus’s genetic material, and antigen tests that detect specific proteins on the surface of the virus. Testing sites listed on this page use viral PCR tests.</p>



<p>Antigen tests usually provide results faster than viral PCR tests at lower cost, but have a higher chance of missing an active infection. &nbsp;Antigen tests are used on people suspected of having COVID-19 within 5-12 days of symptoms appearing. </p>



<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">What is an antibody test? Where can I get an antibody test?</div>



<p><strong>Antibody tests</strong> detect past infections. They can determine if you are a good candidate to <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/plasma">donate blood plasma</a>. It can take 1-3 weeks after infection for your body to make antibodies.</p>



<p>You can find locations for both viral PCR and antibody tests on the <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/Nearby/index.html?appid=43118dc0d5d348d8ab20a81967a15401">COVID-19 Testing Sites in California map</a>.</p>



<h2 id="cost-for-testing">Cost for testing</h2>



<p><strong>There are no out-of-pocket costs for medically-necessary testing.</strong> If you have medical insurance, Verily or OptumServe will bill your insurance company. If you’re uninsured, the government pays for your test.</p>



<h2 id="who-can-get-tested">Who can get tested</h2>



<p>California&#8217;s testing capacity and turnaround time have improved. As a result, until further notice, <strong>all testing requests will have equal priority</strong>.</p>



<p>When demand for tests exceed capacity, CDPH will prioritize testing based on risk, as follows:</p>



<h3>First priority</h3>



<ul><li>Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 symptoms</li><li>Those identified through an outbreak or contact tracing&nbsp; investigation</li></ul>



<h3>Second priority</h3>



<ul><li>All other individuals with COVID-19 symptoms</li><li>Close contacts of confirmed cases&nbsp;</li><li>People without symptoms, but who are:<ul><li>Residents in group living facilities</li><li>Healthcare workers who care for COVID-19 patients</li><li>Workers in group living facilities and in-home support services</li><li>Workers in the emergency service sector who have frequent interactions with the public or people with COVID-19. This includes first responders and other public service departments.</li><li>Workers in correctional facilities</li><li>Hospital admission and discharge patients</li></ul></li></ul>



<h3>Third priority<strong> </strong></h3>



<ul><li>People without symptoms, but who are:<ul><li><a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/essential-workforce/">Essential workers</a></li><li>Education workers who have frequent interactions with students or the public</li></ul></li></ul>



<h3>Fourth priority </h3>



<ul><li>People without symptoms, but who are:<ul><li>At risk of infection&nbsp;</li><li>Being tested by their employer</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>The <a href="https://testing.covid19.ca.gov/">COVID-19 Testing Task Force</a> is working to ensure that Californians have access to tests, and laboratories have capacity to meet demand.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="questions-and-answers">Questions and answers</h2>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Is there an over-the-counter COVID-19 test I can take at home?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144457/download" aria-label="Emergency Use Authorization to Ellume">Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)</a> for an over-the-counter fully at-home diagnostic test for COVID-19. The test is authorized for individuals two years of age or older, including those not showing symptoms.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The home test is a rapid, lateral flow antigen test, a type of test that runs a liquid sample along a surface with reactive molecules. The FDA allows it to be sold in places like drug stores, where a patient can buy it, swab their nose, run the test and find out their results in as little as 20 minutes.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Individuals with positive results should:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Self-isolate</li><li>Seek additional care from their health care provider</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Individuals who test negative and experience COVID-like symptoms should follow up with their health care provider. It is possible to get a negative test result and still be infected with coronavirus.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><br>For more information, see the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-antigen-test-first-over-counter-fully-home-diagnostic" aria-label="">FDA news release</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Is there a <strong>prescription</strong> COVID-19 test I can take at home?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/143810/download" aria-label="Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Lucira">Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)</a> for an at-home COVID-19 diagnostic self-test. The authorization is for home use with self-collected nasal swab samples in individuals aged 14 and older. This test is currently authorized for prescription use only.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The test works by swirling the self-collected sample swab in a vial that is then placed in the test unit. In 30 minutes or less, the results can be read directly from the test unit’s light-up display.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Individuals with positive results should:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Self-isolate</li><li>Seek additional care from their health care provider</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Individuals who test negative and experience COVID-like symptoms should follow up with their health care provider.&nbsp;It is possible to get a negative test result and still be infected with&nbsp;coronavirus.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><br>For more information, see the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-first-covid-19-test-self-testing-home" aria-label="FDA news release about first home test">FDA news release</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How long does it take for coronavirus test results to come back?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Turnaround time for coronavirus test results is usually less than two days. Approximately two-thirds are returned within a day and more than 85% are available within two days.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">This turnaround time includes shipping time. So for labs that process home testing kits, turnaround time may depend on when an individual mails back their kit.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you haven’t received your test results and it’s been several days, contact your healthcare provider, testing service, or local health department.<br><br>Read more at <a href="https://testing.covid19.ca.gov/">California’s COVID-19 Testing Task Force</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Who should get tested for coronavirus?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You should get tested if you:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Had <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/appendix.html#contact">close contact</a> with anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19</li><li>Have COVID-19 symptoms</li><li>Get a call from a contact tracer</li><li>Are at <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Updated-COVID-19-Testing-Guidance.aspx">high risk</a></li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you think you may have been exposed, call your doctor.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">When can I be around other people after I tested positive for COVID-19 but had no symptoms?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you continue to have no symptoms, you can be with others after 10 days have passed since your test.<br><br>The CDC has <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/end-home-isolation.html">detailed recommendations</a> for people who test positive but have no symptoms.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">If I test positive for COVID-19 in a viral test, what should I do to protect others in my household?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You should <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/isolation.html">self-isolate</a> from others in your household who have not tested positive. Sleep and stay in a separate room from them, and use a separate bathroom, if possible. Multiple infected people in the same household can use the same room for isolation.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Members of your household should get tested right away. They should <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html">quarantine</a> for at least 14 days. Symptoms can develop even after testing negative within 14 days after exposure. Multiple people in the same household should not quarantine in the same room, since some may be infected.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How do I get a drive-through test with Verily?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">There are two steps to this process: screening and testing. First, you will create an account and take the <a href="https://lhi.care/covidtesting">online screener</a>. If you are eligible, you will get details on how and where to get tested. Once tested, you’ll get an email or phone call with your COVID-19 test results.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Why am I asked to create an account for testing with Verily?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Verily needs a way to authenticate and protect user information. They turned to Google for this service, because Google accounts have best-in-class authentication. Simply link to an existing Google account or create a new one (which you can do with any email address). Then Verily can contact you securely during the screening and testing process. All data collected by Verily is kept private and is not linked to a user’s Google account.</p>
