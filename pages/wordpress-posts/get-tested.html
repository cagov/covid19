<h4>Free tests if you have private insurance</h4>



<p>Most California insurance plans must pay or reimburse for 8 at-home test kits per month through November 11, 2023. Ask your insurance company for details. Find out more at <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Simple-COVID-19-Coverage-Change.pdf">COVID-19 Coverage Changes</a>.</p>



<h4>Tests if you have Medicare or Medicare Advantage</h4>



<p>Details are different for each plan; contact your provider for more information. Find out more at <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Simple-COVID-19-Coverage-Change.pdf">COVID-19 Coverage Changes</a>.</p>



<h3>Before you throw out &#8220;expired&#8221; tests</h3>



<p><strong>Most at-home tests can be safely used past the date on the box</strong>. Check to see if your COVID-19 tests’ expiration dates have been extended on the FDA’s <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/home-otc-covid-19-diagnostic-tests">At-Home COVID-19 Test page</a>.</p>



<p>Replace your tests with fresh ones as the extended expiration dates approach. If you have to, you can use an expired test until you can get new ones, as long as the control line is working. See your test instructions for details about the control line.&nbsp;</p>
