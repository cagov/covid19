<h4>Get free tests</h4>



<p>You can get free at-home tests mailed to you by the U.S. government. Limits apply.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a class="button-lightblue" href="https://www.covid.gov/tests">Get free tests</a></p>



<p>At-home tests you can get at the store are now free or reimbursable for most people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Free tests if you have Medi-Cal or Medicare</h4>



<p>Follow these steps:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Get the Medi-Cal or Medicare card(s) for each person in your family</strong>. Each person with a Medi-Cal or Medicare card can receive up to 8 free tests (or 4 boxes if each box has 2 tests) each month with their card.</li><li><strong>Go to a pharmacy</strong> or a store with a pharmacy.</li><li><strong>Go to the pharmacy counter where prescriptions are dropped off. </strong>Other registers in the store cannot provide free COVID-19 tests.</li><li><strong>Show your Medi-Cal or Medicare card(s)</strong> and ask for 8 at-home COVID-19 antigen tests for each person.</li></ul>



<h4>Free tests if you have private insurance</h4>



<p>Insurance must pay or reimburse for 8 at-home test kits per month. Ask your insurance company for details. Find out more at <a href="https://www.cms.gov/how-to-get-your-at-home-OTC-COVID-19-test-for-free">How to Get Your At-Home Over-the-Counter COVID-19 Test for Free</a>.</p>



<h4>About expiration dates</h4>



<p><strong>Most at-home antigen tests can be used safely past the expiration date on the box</strong>. The FDA has approved test expiration extensions. Details on the new expiration dates for various at-home test brands can be found on the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/home-otc-covid-19-diagnostic-tests">FDA’s At-Home OTC COVID-19 Diagnostic Tools page</a>.</p>



<p>Tests can also be used past extended FDA expiration dates if the internal test control continues to function properly. This means that the control line is easily visible and is the correct color, as specified by the test instructions, when the test is ready to be read.</p>
