<h2>When to isolate or quarantine</h2>



<p>If you test positive or were exposed to COVID-19, you must isolate or quarantine.</p>



<p><strong>Isolation </strong>means staying home and away from others. It is for people who are ill or test positive.</p>



<p><strong>Quarantine </strong>means staying home. It<strong> </strong>is for people who have been exposed, but test negative.</p>



<h3><strong>If you test positive </strong>or have symptoms</h3>



<p>Regardless of your vaccination status or infection history:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Isolate </strong>until you feel better and test negative<ul><li>Sleep and stay in a separate room from those not infected</li><li>Use a separate bathroom if you can</li><li>Wear a mask around others, even at home</li></ul></li><li>Get tested (antigen preferred) on Day 5 or later</li><li>End isolation on Day 6 if:<ul><li>You test negative, AND</li><li>Have no fever for 24 hours without taking fever-reducing medication, AND</li><li>Your other symptoms are gone or going</li></ul></li><li>End isolation on Day 10 if:<ul><li>You test positive on Day 5 or don’t test, AND</li><li>You have no fever for 24 hours without taking fever-reducing medication</li></ul></li><li>If you still have a fever, continue to isolate until it’s been gone for 24 hours</li><li>After you recover, wear a mask around others for 5 days</li></ul>



<p>For children who test positive:</p>



<ul><li>End isolation on Day 6<ul><li>Children under 2 do not need a negative test to end isolation</li><li>Testing is recommended for children 2 years and older before ending isolation</li></ul></li></ul>

<h3><strong>If you were exposed</strong> but have no symptoms</h3>



<p>What to do next depends on your vaccination status and COVID-19 infection history.</p>



<p>If you’re fully vaccinated and boosted:</p>



<ul><li>You don’t need to stay home unless symptoms start</li><li>Get tested on Day 5 or after</li></ul>



<p>If you had COVID-19 within the last 90 days:</p>



<ul><li>You don’t need to test or stay home unless symptoms start</li></ul>



<p>If you’re not fully vaccinated and boosted:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Quarantine </strong>(stay home) for 5 days</li><li>Wear a mask around others, even at home</li><li>Get tested on Day 5 or after</li><li>End quarantine if you test negative and still have no symptoms</li><li>After quarantine, wear a mask around others for another 5 days</li></ul>

<hr class="wp-block-separator" id="cost-for-testing"/>



<h2>Cost for testing</h2>



<p><strong>There are no out-of-pocket costs for COVID-19 testing at a testing site.</strong> An <a href="https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/Portals/0/Docs/DO/COVID-TestingFactSheet.pdf">insured person can get a COVID-19 test</a> when needed by any provider, in or out of their health plan network, at no cost. If you’re uninsured, the government pays for your test.</p>



<p>But there are some COVID-19 tests you do have to pay for:</p>



<ul><li>At-home test kits&nbsp;</li><li>Some rapid result tests</li></ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" id="testing-at-work"/>



<h2>Testing at work</h2>



<p>Screening tests are recurring tests of people without symptoms in certain high-risk workplaces. They are meant to detect COVID-19 early and stop transmission.</p>



<p>In general,</p>



<ul><li>Fully-vaccinated individuals do not need screening tests in non-healthcare settings.</li><li>Asymptomatic employees in healthcare settings should still get screening tests. This is true no matter their vaccination status. There are a few exceptions:<ul><li>Facilities may stop routine testing of asymptomatic staff who are fully vaccinated where:<ul><li>More than 70% of residents and more than 70% staff are fully vaccinated in a long-term care facility, or</li><li>More than 70% of staff are fully vaccinated in an acute health care facility.</li></ul></li><li>Facilities may continue routine testing for fully-vaccinated staff with compromised immune systems. Examples are those who have undergone organ transplantation or cancer treatment. These conditions might impact the level of protection provided by COVID-19 vaccine.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>Read CDPH’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Updated-COVID-19-Testing-Guidance.aspx">Updated Testing Guidance</a> for more about workplace screening tests.</p>

<h2>Questions and answers</h2>



<h3 class="wp-accordion">What should I do if I may have been exposed to COVID-19?</h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Consider getting tested, even if you’re vaccinated. Know your status so you can avoid infecting others. Wear a mask around others until you’re sure you’re not infected.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you have <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Symptoms-Risks.aspx">symptoms</a>, stay home and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/isolation.html">self-isolate</a> from others in your household.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion">Does my health plan have to cover my COVID-19 test at a testing site?&nbsp;</h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. <a href="https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/Portals/0/Docs/DO/APL21-011-NewFederalGuidanceRegardingCOVID-19Testing.pdf">Federal guidance</a> requires health plans to provide testing at no cost to everyone. You do not need to have symptoms or to have been exposed to COVID-19. You do not need to be an “essential worker” to get tested.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">To get tested you can go to any COVID-19 testing provider authorized or licensed by the state. You do not need to go to a provider that is in your health plan’s or health insurer’s provider network. You do not need to get permission from your health plan or health insurer before going to get a COVID-19 test. And you do not need to pay a co-payment for a COVID-19 test.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion">What if I don’t have health insurance and I need COVID-19 testing or care?</h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">For the uninsured, the <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/CovidUninsuredClaim">government pays</a> for all necessary COVID-19 testing and care. Check your symptoms using the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsymptoms-testing%2Findex.html">Symptom Screener</a> or by talking to your doctor.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion">How long does it take for COVID-19 test results to come back?</h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Turnaround time for COVID-19 test results is usually less than two days. About two-thirds come back within a day, and more than 85% are available within two days.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">This turnaround time includes shipping time. For labs that process home testing kits, turnaround time depends on when you mail back your kit.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you haven’t received your test results and it’s been several days, contact:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Your healthcare provider,</li><li>Testing service, or&nbsp;</li><li>Local health department.</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Read more at <a href="https://testing.covid19.ca.gov/">California’s COVID-19 Testing Task Force</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion">What is acceptable as proof of a negative COVID-19 test result?</h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The following are accepted:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Printed document from your test provider or laboratory</li><li>An email or text message displayed on your phone from your test provider or laboratory</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Results should include name of person tested, type of test, and date of negative test result. For PCR, the negative result must be from the last 3 days. For antigen, the negative result must be from the last day.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">A shorter test window is required at <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/mega-events/">mega-events</a> (over 1,000 people). There you must show a negative PCR test result from within the last 2 days, or a negative antigen test result from within the last day. Children under 2 are exempt from testing.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion">When can I be around other people after I tested positive for COVID-19 but had no symptoms?</h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you continue to have no symptoms:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Test again after 5 days. If you test negative, you can be with others.</li><li>Wear a mask around others for another 5 days, even at home.</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The CDC has <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/end-home-isolation.html">recommendations</a> for people who test positive but have no symptoms.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion">If I test positive for COVID-19, what should I do to protect others in my household?</h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You should <strong>self-isolate</strong> (stay home and away from others). Avoid those in your household who have not tested positive: </p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Sleep and stay in a separate room from them</li><li>Use a separate bathroom, if possible. Multiple infected people in the same household can use the same room for isolation.</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Multiple infected people in the same household can use the same room for isolation.

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Members of your household should consider getting tested and masking until they are sure they are not infected. Depending on their vaccination status, they may need to <strong>quarantine </strong>(stay home).</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">They do not have to test or quarantine if:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>They are fully vaccinated and got a booster against COVID-19 and show no symptoms</li><li>They had a confirmed case of COVID-19 within the last 90 days.</li></ul>

<h3 class="wp-accordion">What support does California provide during COVID isolation or quarantine?</h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you can’t work because you have COVID-19 or are near someone who has it, you can file a <a href="https://edd.ca.gov/Disability/How_to_File_a_DI_Claim_in_SDI_Online.htm/t_blank">Disability Insurance (DI) claim</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you can’t work because you are caring for a family member with COVID-19, there is help for your lost wages. File a <a href="https://edd.ca.gov/Disability/How_to_File_a_PFL_Claim_in_SDI_Online.htm/t_blank">Paid Family Leave (PFL) claim</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">In both these cases, you must have a note from a healthcare worker.</p>
