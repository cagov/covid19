<h2>About long COVID </h2>



<p>Many people with COVID-19 get better within weeks, but some people have symptoms that last for months. This can happen to anyone who has had COVID-19, even if the initial illness was mild. This is known as a post-COVID condition, or simply as “long COVID.” Since July 2021, long COVID has been recognized as a disability under the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/civil-rights-covid19/guidance-long-covid-disability/index.html">Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</a>.</p>



<p>People of any age can develop long COVID, but research suggests it is more common in adults than in children.</p>

<h2>Where to get care for a post-COVID condition</h2>



<p>If you think you have a post-COVID condition, talk to your doctor. If you have insurance, you can call the number on your insurance card to get help with making an appointment.</p>



<p>You can also make an appointment with an <a href="https://www.survivorcorps.com/pccc-ca">outpatient clinic specializing in post-COVID care</a>. Some clinics offer virtual programs that allow you to talk to a doctor without leaving your home.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" id="planning"/>



<h2>Planning for your appointment</h2>



<p>Make sure you have everything you need for your appointment, whether you are seeing a doctor in person or online. Download the CDC’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/post-covid-appointment/appointment-checklist.pdf">Checklist for Post-COVID Conditions.</a></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" id="tools"/>



<h2>Tools for recovery</h2>



<p>For some patients, home exercises help with recovery. Ask your doctor about exercises that can help with common COVID-19 side effects. For some people with post-COVID conditions, too much exercise can make their symptoms worse, so it is important to take things slowly.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator" id="support-groups"/>



<h2>Support groups for post-COVID conditions</h2>



<p>People with long COVID may benefit from support groups. Visit the following websites for more information. You may be asked to fill out a form to verify that you are a real person in need of support.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.wearebodypolitic.com/covid-19">Body Politic</a></li><li><a href="https://www.longcovidkids.org/support-services">Long COVID Kids</a> provides free support services for families and children with long COVID</li></ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" id="benefits"/>



<h2>Long COVID disability benefits</h2>



<p>People who are unable to work due to long COVID symptoms may be eligible for disability benefits. To qualify as a disability, it must greatly limit one or more major life activities. An evaluation is needed to determine if your condition can be considered a disability.</p>



<p>If your illness meets the definition of a disability, you can <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/applyfordisability/">apply for disability benefits online</a>.</p>



<p>If long COVID affects your ability to work, you may be able to ask your employer for accommodations to help you do your job. Visit the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/odep/topics/coronavirus-covid-19-long-covid">US Department of Labor website</a> for more information.</p>
