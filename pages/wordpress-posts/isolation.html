<h2>Quarantine vs. isolation</h2>



<p><strong>Quarantine </strong>means staying home after an exposure but before symptoms start. Quarantine<strong> </strong>is no longer recommended as a strategy for controlling COVID-19.</p>



<p><strong>Isolation </strong>means staying home and away from others in your household if you have symptoms or you test positive. If you test positive, contact your doctor to see if you should receive treatment. COVID-19 treatments are free, widely available, and reduce the risk of serious illness. <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/treatment/">Learn about your treatment options</a>.</p>
