<h2>Quarantine vs. isolation</h2>



<p><strong>Quarantine </strong>means staying home. It<strong> </strong>is no longer required for most people who have been exposed, but test negative. But it may be recommended if you live or work in a high-risk setting.</p>



<p><strong>Isolation </strong>means staying home and away from others in your household. It is for people who are ill or test positive.</p>
