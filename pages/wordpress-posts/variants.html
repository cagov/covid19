<p class="emphasized">We track COVID-19 variants in California to control the spread of the disease.</p>

<h2 id="normal-part-of-viruses">Variants are a normal part of viruses</h2>



<p>Viruses change through mutations that create new strains of virus over time. This is a normal process that happens with most viruses. We call these strains variants.</p>



<p>Some variants rise and then disappear. Other variants become common. Most variants do not have a meaningful impact.</p>



<h2 id="tracking">Variants we’re tracking</h2>



<h3>Variants of concern</h3>



<p>Variants of concern are likely to have one or more of the following features:</p>



<ul><li>More contagious</li><li>Likely to cause more severe symptoms</li><li>Resistant to treatment</li><li>More resistant to vaccines</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-table aligncenter"><table><thead><tr><th>Variant</th><th>Known differences</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Delta</td><td><ul><li>200% increased transmission</li><li>Reduced antibody treatment effectiveness</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h3>Variants being monitored</h3>



<p>Variants being monitored are seen at low levels or no longer detected. They do not pose a significant or immediate risk to the public. They are likely to have one or more of the following features:</p>



<ul><li>Potential or known effect on treatment</li><li>More severe symptoms</li><li>Increased transmission</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-table aligncenter"><table><thead><tr><th>Variant</th><th>Known differences</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Alpha</td><td><ul><li>50% increased transmission</li><li>Potential increased disease severity and risk of death</li><li>Minimal impact on antibody treatment effectiveness</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Beta</td><td><ul><li>50% increased transmission</li><li>Reduced antibody treatment effectiveness</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Gamma</td><td><ul><li>Reduced antibody treatment effectiveness</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Epsilon</td><td><ul><li>20% increased transmission</li><li>Significantly reduced antibody treatment effectiveness</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Eta</td><td><ul><li>Moderately decreased antibody treatment effectiveness</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Iota</td><td><ul><li>Significantly reduced antibody treatment effectiveness</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Kappa</td><td><ul><li>Moderately decreased antibody treatment effectiveness</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Zeta</td><td><ul><li>Moderately decreased antibody treatment effectiveness</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Mu</td><td><ul><li>Moderately decreased antibody treatment effectiveness</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>California follows the CDC’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/variant-surveillance/variant-info.html">variant classifications and definitions</a>.</p>



<h2 id="vaccine-effectiveness">Vaccine effectiveness against variants</h2>



<p>We are working to better understand how these variants respond to vaccination. Vaccines provide valuable protection against variants circulating in California.</p>



<p>COVID-19 vaccines are effective against variants of the virus currently circulating in the United States, including the Delta variant. We are closely following evolving information about the ability of COVID-19 vaccines to protect against variants.</p>



<h2 id="in-california">Variants in California</h2>



<p>We genetically sequence a sample of positive COVID-19 tests to determine which variant they are. This helps us understand which variants are circulating in California.</p>
