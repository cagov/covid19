<h2 id="eviction-protection">Eviction protection for renters</h2>



<p>If you cannot pay your full rent because of COVID-19, state law protects you from eviction until September 30, 2021. This applies to all residential tenants, regardless of immigration status.</p>



<p>To avoid eviction, <strong>you must</strong>:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Give your landlord a </strong><a href="https://landlordtenant.dre.ca.gov/tenant/forms.html"><strong>signed declaration</strong></a><strong> </strong>within 15 business days if you get a notice from your landlord demanding rent payment, and</li><li><strong>Pay 25% of all total rent</strong> due in the last 12 months (from September 2020 through September 2021) <strong>by September 30, 2021</strong></li></ul>



<p>Your landlord can take you to small claims court for unpaid rent beginning November 1, 2021.</p>

<h2 id="rent-help">Help with rent and utility payments</h2>



<p>Qualified renters and landlords can get financial help to cover 100% of:</p>



<ul><li>Past due and future rent payments</li><li>Past due and future utility bills</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://housing.ca.gov/covid_rr/index.html"><strong>Apply online</strong></a><strong> for the California COVID-19 rent relief program</strong>, or call <a href="tel:833‑430‑2122">833‑430‑2122</a>.</p>



<p>You can apply as a renter or a landlord, and both are encouraged to work together.</p>



<h3>Renters</h3>



<p>Your immigration status does not matter. You are not required to show proof of citizenship to apply.</p>



<p>Your landlord will be notified that you have applied for rent relief. Your landlord will not see your application. Your information is private and will not be shared.</p>



<p>Your application will be assigned to a case manager. Watch for emails or phone calls from your case manager about your application. Be sure to respond so your application keeps moving.</p>



<h3>Where payments are sent</h3>



<p>If your application gets approved, rent payments go to:</p>



<ul><li>Your landlord if your landlord is participating in the rent relief program</li><li>You if your landlord does not participate in the program</li></ul>



<p>Utility payments go directly to the utility provider.</p>

<h2 id="mortgage-forbearance">Mortgage forbearance for homeowners</h2>



<p>Most homeowners can pause or reduce their mortgage payments for a limited time if they’re struggling because of COVID-19. This is called <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/help-for-homeowners/learn-about-forbearance/">forbearance</a>. You request forbearance from your mortgage servicer. Landlords with four properties or less can also request forbearance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Learn the steps to pause or reduce your mortgage payments at <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/help-for-homeowners/">Help for homeowners</a>.</p>



<p>Your deadline to request forbearance depends on who backs your mortgage.</p>



<ul><li>If your loan is backed by HUD/FHA, USDA, or VA, the deadline for requesting an initial forbearance is September 30, 2021.</li><li>If your loan is backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, there currently is not a deadline for requesting an initial forbearance.</li></ul>



<p>If your mortgage is not federally backed, your servicer may offer similar forbearance options. If you are struggling to make your mortgage payments, your servicer must discuss relief options with you.</p>



<h3>Your rights if you’re denied forbearance</h3>



<p>If your servicer denies your request for forbearance, they must provide you with:</p>



<ul><li>A detailed description explaining why your request was denied, and</li><li>The specific reasons for the denial</li></ul>



<p>This is true for all mortgages, whether federally-backed or not.</p>



<p>If the explanation says your request has errors or is missing information, you have 21 days to correct these issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you requested forbearance, your lender cannot begin foreclosing on your home or property until they:</p>



<ul><li>Contact you to request payment</li><li>Wait at least 30 days after contacting you to request payment</li><li>File a declaration that they have contacted you to request payment</li><li>File the forbearance denial notice</li></ul>



<p>You can contest either the 30-day contact or the forbearance denial notice.</p>



<p>If you believe your lender harmed you by violating the law, you can file a lawsuit against them. You can get free or low-cost <a href="https://housing.ca.gov/resources/tenant.html">legal help</a> from statewide and local organizations.</p>
