<h2>Golden State Stimulus payments</h2>



<p>Households earning $75,000 or less may qualify for at least one type of Golden State Stimulus (GSS) payment. This includes undocumented workers. Families with children may receive an increased payment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two types of GSS payments, GSS I and GSS II.</p>



<h3>Deadline to qualify</h3>



<p><strong>You must </strong><a href="https://www.ftb.ca.gov/file/ways-to-file/index.html"><strong>file your 2020 tax return</strong></a><strong> by October 15, 2021</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your 2020 tax return determines if you’re eligible to receive GSS payments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you qualify, you’ll receive your payments by direct deposit or a check in the mail.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’ve already filed your 2020 tax return, you do not have to do anything else.&nbsp;</p>
