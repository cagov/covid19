<h2><strong>California Eviction Moratorium</strong></h2>



<p>California issued a statewide moratorium on residential evictions for renters who cannot pay their rent because of COVID-19 related economic hardships. The moratorium went into effect on March 27 and is extended through July 28, 2020. ​</p>



<p>If COVID-19 has impacted your ability to pay all or part of your rent, you should:</p>



<ul><li>Explain your financial situation to your landlord and relay how much you are able to pay&nbsp;</li><li>Save all financial documents&nbsp;</li><li>Pay as much of your rent as you can</li></ul>



<p>If your landlord is attempting to evict you for not paying rent and you took all of the above steps,  contact a local legal aid provider.</p>



<h2>Relief from financial institutions</h2>



<p>The State of California is working to soften the financial impact of COVID-19 on residents who are struggling to pay their mortgage and bills. Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase, US Bank, Wells Fargo, and nearly 200 state-chartered banks, credit unions, and servicers have committed to providing relief for consumers and homeowners in California.</p>



<p>See the <a href="https://dbo.ca.gov/covid19-updates-fi/">list of participating financial institutions</a>. </p>



<p>Under the Governor’s proposal, Californians who are struggling with the COVID-19 crisis may be eligible for the following relief after contacting their financial institution:</p>



<h4><strong>90-day grace period for all mortgage payments</strong></h4>



<p>If you are impacted by COVID-19, these <a href="https://dbo.ca.gov/covid19-updates-fi/">financial institutions</a> will offer mortgage-payment forbearances of up to 90 days, which allow you to reduce or delay your monthly mortgage payment. In addition, they will:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Give you a streamlined process for requesting forbearance for COVID-19-related reasons, supported with available documentation;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Confirm approval of and terms of forbearance program; and</li></ul>



<ul><li>Provide you the opportunity to extend your forbearance agreement if you continue to experience hardship due to COVID-19.</li></ul>



<h4><strong>Relief from fees and charges for 90 days</strong></h4>



<p>For at least 90 days, <a href="https://dbo.ca.gov/covid19-updates-fi/">financial institutions</a><strong> </strong>will waive or refund mortgage-related late fees and other fees including early CD withdrawals. </p>



<h4><strong>No new foreclosures for 60 days</strong></h4>



<p><a href="https://dbo.ca.gov/covid19-updates-fi/">Financial institutions</a> will not start any foreclosure sales or evictions.</p>



<h4><strong>No credit score changes for accessing relief</strong></h4>



<p>If you are taking advantage of this COVID-19-related relief, late or missed payments will not be shared with credit reporting agencies. </p>
