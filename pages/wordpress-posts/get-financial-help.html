<h2>Questions and answers</h2>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What effect will late payments have on my credit report?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Financial institutions will not report derogatory information (like late payments) to credit reporting agencies, but may report a forbearance. Typically this does not negatively affect a credit score on its own.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How long will financial relief programs last?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It’s unclear how severe or how long COVID-19 will affect California. Financial institutions have committed to necessary relief and will assess ongoing conditions and need for continuing relief.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What if my financial institution isn’t offering this relief?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Call or check their website to be sure. At this time, JP Morgan Chase, US Bank, Wells Fargo and Citigroup, <a href="https://dbo.ca.gov/covid19-updates-fi/">and nearly 200 state-chartered banks</a> and credit unions are supporting these commitments.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Is mortgage relief available to businesses?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The relief is currently only available for residential mortgages.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What if my mortgage servicer is not communicative or cooperative?</h4>
