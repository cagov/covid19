<h2>Eviction protection for renters</h2>



<p>If you cannot pay your full rent because of COVID-19, state law protects you from eviction until September 30, 2021. This applies to all residential tenants, regardless of immigration status.</p>



<h3>Current eviction protection</h3>



<p>To avoid eviction, <strong>you must</strong>:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Give your landlord a </strong><a href="https://landlordtenant.dre.ca.gov/tenant/forms.html"><strong>signed declaration</strong></a><strong> </strong>within 15 days of getting a notice to pay rent</li><li><strong>Pay 25% of all rent</strong> due from September 2020 through September 2021 <strong>by September 30, 2021</strong></li></ul>



<p>This protects you from eviction through September 30, 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Unpaid rent</h3>



<p>If you still owe any rent after September 30, 2021, your landlord can sue you starting November 1, 2021. This is true even if you paid 25% of your rent to avoid eviction. <a href="https://housing.ca.gov/covid_rr/index.html">Apply for rent relief</a> to cover 100% of past due rent.</p>



<h3>Eviction protection after September 30, 2021</h3>



<p>To avoid eviction for unpaid rent after September 30, 2021, you must <a href="https://housing.ca.gov/covid_rr/index.html">apply for rent relief</a>. Your landlord cannot evict you if you’ve applied and are waiting to find out if you&#8217;re eligible. This protection lasts until March 31, 2022.</p>



<p>If you get a notice from your landlord demanding rent payment, make sure you apply within 15 days.</p>



<p>If you owe rent and do not apply for rent relief, your landlord can evict you. Your landlord must apply for rent relief before they can evict you for unpaid rent.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator" id="mortgage-forbearance"/>



<h2>Mortgage forbearance for homeowners and landlords</h2>



<p>Most homeowners can pause or reduce their mortgage payments for a limited time if they’re struggling because of COVID-19. This is called <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/help-for-homeowners/learn-about-forbearance/">forbearance</a>. You request forbearance from your mortgage servicer. Landlords with four properties or less can also request forbearance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Learn the steps to pause or reduce your mortgage payments at <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/help-for-homeowners/">Help for homeowners</a>.</p>



<p>Your deadline to request forbearance depends on who backs your mortgage.</p>



<ul><li>If your loan is backed by HUD/FHA, USDA, or VA, the deadline for requesting an initial forbearance is September 30, 2021.</li><li>If your loan is backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, there currently is not a deadline for requesting an initial forbearance.</li></ul>



<p>If your mortgage is not federally backed, your servicer may offer similar forbearance options. If you are struggling to make your mortgage payments, your servicer must discuss relief options with you.</p>



<h3>Your rights if you’re denied forbearance</h3>



<p>If your servicer denies your request for forbearance, they must provide you with:</p>



<ul><li>A detailed description explaining why your request was denied, and</li><li>The specific reasons for the denial</li></ul>



<p>This is true for all mortgages, whether federally-backed or not.</p>



<p>If the explanation says your request has errors or is missing information, you have 21 days to correct these issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you requested forbearance, your lender cannot begin foreclosing on your home or property until they:</p>



<ul><li>Contact you to request payment</li><li>Wait at least 30 days after contacting you to request payment</li><li>File a declaration that they have contacted you to request payment</li><li>File the forbearance denial notice</li></ul>



<p>You can contest either the 30-day contact or the forbearance denial notice.</p>



<p>If you believe your lender harmed you by violating the law, you can file a lawsuit against them. You can get free or low-cost <a href="https://housing.ca.gov/resources/tenant.html">legal help</a> from statewide and local organizations.</p>



<p>These protections are in effect until December 1, 2021, if you’re denied forbearance.</p>

<h2>Golden State Stimulus payments</h2>



<p>Households earning $75,000 or less may qualify for at least one type of Golden State Stimulus (GSS) payment. This includes undocumented workers. Families with children may receive an increased payment.&nbsp;</p>
