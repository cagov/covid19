<h2 class="js-qa js-qa-answer" id="higher-risk">Who is likely to get very sick</h2>



<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">Who is at high risk for a severe case of COVID-19?</div>

<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">There are more conditions which might increase risk for severe illness from COVID-19. See <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html">what specific actions you should take for your medical condition</a>.</p>



<h2>Extra precautions for high-risk groups</h2>



<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">What should people at higher risk for serious illness, like seniors or those with compromised immune systems, do to protect themselves?</div>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">If you are at higher risk for serious illness, you should take extra precautions to protect yourself:</p>



<ul class="js-qa js-qa-answer"><li><strong>Stay home.</strong> It&#8217;s the most important thing you can do.</li><li><strong>Avoid contact with people who are sick.</strong> Isolate anyone sick in your home in a separate room, if possible.</li><li><strong>Get food brought to your house</strong> through family, social, or commercial networks.

<h3>Questions and answers</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What do I need to know about COVID-19 and wildfire smoke?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Air pollutants from wildfire smoke can irritate the lungs, cause inflammation, weaken your immune system, and increase your risk of respiratory infections like COVID-19. Also, wildfire smoke exposure can worsen COVID-19 symptoms and outcomes.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Keep in mind that some respiratory symptoms from wildfire smoke exposure and COVID-19 may be similar. These include cough, sore throat, and difficulty breathing.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">COVID-19 symptoms that are unrelated to smoke exposure include fever or chills, muscle or body aches, and diarrhea. If you think you may have COVID-19, contact your doctor.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The CDC has more detailed information about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/smoke-faq.html">Wildfire Smoke and COVID-19</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What are the similarities and differences between Influenza (flu) and COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Influenza (flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they’re caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html#Basics">new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2)</a> and flu is caused by <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/index.htm">influenza viruses</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar. It is hard to tell the difference between them without testing.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Cases of COVID-19 and flu can have anything from no symptoms (asymptomatic) to severe symptoms. Common symptoms that COVID-19 and flu share include:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Fever or chills</li><li>Cough</li><li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li><li>Fatigue (tiredness)</li><li>Sore throat</li><li>Runny or stuffy nose</li><li>Muscle pain or body aches</li><li>Headache</li><li>Vomiting and diarrhea (more common in children than adults)</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The major difference between them is COVID-19 may include change in or loss of taste or smell.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The CDC has more information about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm">similarities and differences between the flu and COVID-19.</a></p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Who is at risk of infection with coronavirus, which causes COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Anyone can get infected with coronavirus. Currently, those at greatest risk of infection are persons who have had prolonged, unprotected <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/appendix.html#contact">close contact</a> (within 6 feet for 15 minutes or longer) with a patient with confirmed coronavirus infection, regardless of whether the patient has symptoms. Those frequently in group settings (like homeless shelters, assisted living facilities, or college dormitories) are at increased risk of acquiring infection because of the increased likelihood of close contact. Those who live in or have recently been to areas with sustained transmission may also be at higher risk of infection. Everyone can reduce the risk to themselves and others by:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Wearing a mask&nbsp;</li><li>Practicing physical distancing&nbsp;</li><li>Washing their hands often, and&nbsp;</li><li>Taking <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html">other prevention measures</a>.</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can air conditioning spread COVID-19 from one room to another?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">There is no evidence that COVID-19 spreads indoors through air conditioning. There are a wide variety of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Well-designed HVAC systems can actually help reduce risk. Since the system filters air as it circulates, it adds cleaner air to the space. Introduction of fresh outdoor air dilutes the concentration of infectious particles. Air conditioning is also necessary in some areas to protect from excessive heat.
