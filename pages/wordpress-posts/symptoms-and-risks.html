<h4 class="wp-accordion">What are the similarities and differences between Influenza (flu) and COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Influenza (flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they’re caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html#Basics">new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2)</a> and flu is caused by <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/index.htm">influenza viruses</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar. It is hard to tell the difference between them without testing.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Cases of COVID-19 and flu can have anything from no symptoms (asymptomatic) to severe symptoms. Common symptoms that COVID-19 and flu share include:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Fever or chills</li><li>Cough</li><li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li><li>Fatigue (tiredness)</li><li>Sore throat</li><li>Runny or stuffy nose</li><li>Muscle pain or body aches</li><li>Headache</li><li>Vomiting and diarrhea (more common in children than adults)</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The major difference between them is COVID-19 may include change in or loss of taste or smell.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The CDC has more information about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm">similarities and differences between the flu and COVID-19.</a></p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Who is at risk of infection with coronavirus, which causes COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Anyone can get infected with coronavirus. Currently, those at greatest risk of infection are persons who have had prolonged, unprotected <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/appendix.html#contact">close contact</a> (within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes over a 24-hour period) with a patient with confirmed coronavirus infection, regardless of whether the patient has symptoms. Those frequently in group settings (like homeless shelters, assisted living facilities, or college dormitories) are at increased risk of acquiring infection because of the increased likelihood of close contact. Those who live in or have recently been to areas with sustained transmission may also be at higher risk of infection. Everyone can reduce the risk to themselves and others by:</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">What is the risk of children getting sick with COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Children can be infected with coronavirus and can get sick with COVID-19. Most children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, or they may have no symptoms at all (“asymptomatic”). Fewer children have been sick with COVID-19 compared to adults. However, children with certain <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html#children-underlying-conditions">underlying medical conditions</a> and infants (less than 1 year old) might be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Some children have developed a rare but serious disease that is linked to COVID-19 called <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/children/mis-c.html">multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C)</a>.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">What are the long term effects of COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The disease has not existed long enough for us to really know. But as the pandemic unfolds, we are learning that many organs besides the lungs are affected by COVID-19, and there are many ways it can affect someone’s health.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">While most people with COVID-19 recover and return to normal health, some patients can have symptoms that can last for weeks or even months after recovery from acute illness. Even people who are not hospitalized and who have mild illness can experience persistent or late symptoms.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The most commonly reported long-term symptoms include:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Fatigue</li><li>Shortness of breath</li><li>Cough</li><li>Joint pain</li><li>Chest pain</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Other reported long-term symptoms include:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Difficulty with thinking and concentration (sometimes referred to as “brain fog”)</li><li>Depression</li><li>Muscle pain</li><li>Headache</li><li>Intermittent fever</li><li>Fast-beating or pounding heart (also known as heart palpitations)</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">More serious long-term complications appear to be less common but have been reported. These have been noted to affect different organ systems in the body. These include:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Cardiovascular: inflammation of the heart muscle</li><li>Respiratory: lung function abnormalities</li><li>Renal: acute kidney injury</li><li>Dermatologic: rash, hair loss</li><li>Neurological: smell and taste problems, sleep issues, difficulty with concentration, memory problems</li><li>Psychiatric: depression, anxiety, changes in mood</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The long-term significance of these effects is not yet known.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">See the CDC’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects.html">Long-Term Effects of COVID-19 </a>for more details.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can people who recover from COVID-19 be re-infected?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">We don’t yet know. The duration of immunity to coronavirus infection is not yet understood. Patients infected with similar viruses are unlikely to be re-infected in the months after they recover. But we don’t yet know if&nbsp; similar immune protection happens in patients with COVID-19.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Who needs to quarantine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You should <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/CDPH-Home-Quarantine-Guidance_9-16-2020.pdf">self-quarantine</a> if you have had close contact with someone who has COVID-19. If you tested positive for COVID-19 in the 3 months prior to the close contact but do not currently have symptoms, you do not need to quarantine or be tested again. If you develop symptoms, you may need to quarantine and be tested again.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You have had <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/appendix.html#contact">close contact</a> if:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>You were within 6 feet of someone who has COVID-19 for 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period</li><li>You provided care at home to someone who is sick with COVID-19</li><li>You had direct physical contact with the person (like hugging or kissing them)</li><li>You shared eating or drinking utensils</li><li>They sneezed, coughed, or somehow got respiratory droplets on you</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Travelers are strongly discouraged from entering into California for tourism and recreation. If you do travel into California, you will need to <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/CDPH-Home-Quarantine-Guidance_9-16-2020.pdf">self-quarantine</a> for 10 days after you arrive, and should limit your interactions to people in your household. If you are traveling into California for essential purposes, you should still self-quarantine for 10 days and ensure you do not mix with others outside of those necessary to conduct your essential work. See the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/travel/">Travel page for more information</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can COVID-19 be spread by airborne transmission?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It’s possible. Under certain conditions, people with COVID-19 seem to have infected others who were more than 6 feet away. These transmissions occurred within enclosed spaces that had inadequate ventilation. Sometimes the infected person was breathing heavily, for example while singing or exercising.</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Under these circumstances, scientists believe that the amount of infectious smaller droplets and particles produced by the people with COVID-19 became concentrated enough to spread the virus to other people. The people who were infected were in the same space during the same time or shortly after the person with COVID-19 had left.</li><li>It is much more common for the virus to spread through <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/appendix.html#contact">close contact</a> with a person who has COVID-19 than through airborne transmission.</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How do I protect myself and others from COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to coronavirus. You can take steps to slow the spread.</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html">Stay at least 6 feet away from others</a>, whenever possible. This is very important in preventing the spread of COVID-19.</li><li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">Cover your mouth and nose with a mask</a> when around others. This helps reduce the risk of spread both by close contact and by airborne transmission.</li><li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html">Wash your hands</a> often with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li><li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/deciding-to-go-out.html">Avoid crowded indoor spaces</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/disinfecting-your-home.html#ventilation">ensure indoor spaces are properly ventilated</a> by bringing in outdoor air as much as possible. In general, being outdoors and in spaces with good ventilation reduces the risk of exposure to infectious respiratory droplets.</li><li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html">Stay home and isolate</a> from others when sick.</li><li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/disinfecting-your-home.html">Routinely clean and disinfect</a> frequently touched surfaces.</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Pandemics can be stressful, especially when you are staying away from others. During this time, it’s important to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/managing-stress-anxiety.html#community">maintain social connections and care for your mental health</a>.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Learn more about what you can do to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html">protect yourself and others</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can air conditioning spread COVID-19 from one room to another?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">There is no evidence that COVID-19 spreads indoors through air conditioning. There are a wide variety of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Well-designed HVAC systems can actually help reduce risk. Since the system filters air as it circulates, it adds cleaner air to the space. Introduction of fresh outdoor air dilutes the concentration of infectious particles. Air conditioning is also necessary in some areas to protect from excessive heat. For more information, see <a href="https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/resources">ASHRAE guidelines for homeowners and HVAC professionals</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What do I need to know about COVID-19 and wildfire smoke?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Air pollutants from wildfire smoke can irritate the lungs, cause inflammation, weaken your immune system, and increase your risk of respiratory infections like COVID-19. Also, wildfire smoke exposure can worsen COVID-19 symptoms and outcomes.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Keep in mind that some respiratory symptoms from wildfire smoke exposure and COVID-19 may be similar. These include cough, sore throat, and difficulty breathing.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">COVID-19 symptoms that are unrelated to smoke exposure include fever or chills, muscle or body aches, and diarrhea. If you think you may have COVID-19, contact your doctor.</p>
