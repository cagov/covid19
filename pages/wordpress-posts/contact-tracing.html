<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/open-america/contact-tracing/index.html">Contact tracing</a> is an important step in slowing the spread of COVID-19. It&#8217;s when health workers notify you that you&#8217;ve been in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/appendix.html#contact">close contact</a> with an infected person. They will tell you how to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html">quarantine</a> or <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/isolation.html">isolate</a> and get tested. Public health departments have used contact tracing for decades to fight infectious disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Introducing <strong>California Connected</strong>, our state’s contact tracing program.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image text-center"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized">
    <img width="302" src="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/img/CAConnected_Logo_Tag_4C--en.png" alt="Connected California">
  </figure></div>



<p>Under this program, health workers will talk to those who have tested positive. They&#8217;ll alert anyone they may have exposed, keeping names confidential. They&#8217;ll:</p>



<ul><li>check symptoms</li><li>offer testing</li><li>discuss next steps like quarantine, self-isolation, and medical care.</li></ul>



<p>By finding spread patterns quickly, we slow infection and help avoid <a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/employer-playbook-for-safe-reopening--en.pdf">outbreaks</a>. This lets California keep healthcare needs below capacity and safely reopen businesses.</p>



<h2>All you have to do is answer a phone call</h2>



<p>Contact tracing is an anonymous way to do your part. The more people answer the call, the more lives and jobs California saves. Your information is always kept confidential.</p>



<p>Early awareness helps you protect your friends and loved ones from exposure. And early medical care can improve your outcome.</p>



<p>The sooner we can reach you, the sooner you can get advice, testing, and support.</p>



<h2>How does contact tracing work?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/wp/californiaconnected_infographic_english_05192020-1.pdf"><img src="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/img/California-Connected-Infographic--en.jpg" alt="California Connected: Keeping Our Families and Communities Healthy.
Contact tracing is a simple, confidential process that has been used by public health departments for decades to slow the spread of infectious disease and avoid outbreaks. The more people who answer the call, the more lives and jobs California saves.
How does contact tracing work? If you test positive for COVID-19: Separate yourself from those in your home and avoid contact with others to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Your local health department will contact you.
They will connect you to medical care and help you find resources and support if needed. They may stay in touch with you to see if you're okay.
They will ask about places you have been and the people you have spent time with recently. Your information is confidential and will not be shared, and you will not be asked about your immigration status.
Those people will be told they may have been exposed, but they will NOT be told your name or any personal information.
If you have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19:
You will receive a call from a public health worker who will help you understand the next steps.
They will provide access at no cost to you and medical care, if needed. You will also be asked to separate yourself from others in your home to protect those around you. They will stay in touch to see if you develop symptoms or need access to help.

<h2>Questions and answers</h2>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What is a close contact?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">A <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/appendix.html#contact">close contact</a> is someone who was within 6 feet of a person with COVID-19 for at least 15 minutes starting from 2 days before symptoms appeared (or, for asymptomatic patients, 2 days prior to their test) until the time the patient is isolated. This usually includes household members, intimate contacts, and caregivers, but can include others.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will contact tracers track my location?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">California’s contact tracing program does not use any cell phone tracking technology.
