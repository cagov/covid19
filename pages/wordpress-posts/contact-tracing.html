      <p><strong>Contact tracing is when public health workers identify and notify the people who were exposed to infected people. </strong> They let them know that they&#8217;ve been in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/appendix.html#contact">close contact</a> with an infected person, and what to do next to keep themselves and their loved ones safe. Public health departments have used contact tracing for decades to fight the spread of infectious diseases. </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>



<h3>How does it work?</h3>



<p>Public health workers get in touch with those who have tested positive. They might do this by calling on the phone or sending a short survey by text or email. People who have tested positive may be asked about people they were with who they may have exposed while they were contagious. Public health workers then call or text those close contacts to let them know that they may have been exposed. When they do this, they keep the name of the person who tested positive confidential.</p>

<h3>Contact tracing in California</h3>



<p><strong>California Connected</strong> is our state’s contact tracing program.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image text-center"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized">
    <img width="302" src="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/img/CAConnected_Logo_Tag_4C--en.png" alt="California Connected">
  </figure></div>



<p>By helping infected and exposed people self-isolate or self-quarantine, we can slow the spread of the infection and help avoid <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/ab685.aspx">outbreaks</a>. This helps California support those who are infected or exposed, while also keeping their loved ones and&nbsp;communities safe from the spread of infection. This also helps our hospitals and healthcare systems manage caring for the patients who develop serious illness. Contact tracing is a necessary activity that allows us to safely reopen schools and businesses.</p>



<h3>How you can participate</h3>



<div class="container py-4">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
      <p><strong>Contact tracing works when you answer the call or text.</strong></p><p>All you have to do is answer the phone call or respond to the text message survey sent by your local health department.</p>
<p>Contact tracing is an anonymous way to do your part. The more people answer the call or text, the more lives and jobs California will save and the faster we can re-open schools and businesses and keep them open. Your information is always kept confidential.

<h2 id="questions">Questions and answers</h2>



<h4 class="wp-accordion" id="California-COVID-Notify">How can I participate in California COVID Notify, Google and Apple’s exposure notification system?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You can add your phone to the COVID fight by turning on CA Notify, California’s exposure notification system. This system does not track your personal information or location. For details, see the <a href="https://canotify.ca.gov/">CA Notify</a> website or call 888-421-9457 (888-4C19-HLP).</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What is a close contact?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">A <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/appendix.html#contact">close contact</a> is someone who was within 6 feet of a person with COVID-19 for at least 15 minutes over a 24-hour period starting from 2 days before symptoms appeared (or, for patients who do not have symptoms, 2 days prior to their test) until the time the patient is isolated.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You are also a close contact if:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>You provided care at the home of someone who is sick with COVID-19</li><li>You had direct physical contact with the person (such as hugging or kissing them)</li><li>You shared eating or drinking utensils</li><li>They sneezed, coughed, or somehow got respiratory droplets on you.</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Am I considered a close contact if I was wearing a mask?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, you are still considered a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/appendix.html#contact">close contact</a> even if you were wearing a mask while you were around someone with COVID-19. Studies suggest masks offer some protection to the wearer, as well as help to protect other people in case you are infected but they are not 100% guaranteed to stop<br>transmission.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will contact tracers track my location?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No, California’s contact tracing program does not use any cell phone tracking technology. Laboratories who identify positive cases are required to provide contact information to Public Health. Someone from your local public health department will speak privately with you. All information is confidential and protected by California’s strict privacy laws. They may stay in touch to make sure your symptoms aren’t worsening.</p>
