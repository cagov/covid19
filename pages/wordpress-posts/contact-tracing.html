<p>Contact tracing is an important step in slowing the spread of COVID-19. It&#8217;s when health workers notify you that you&#8217;ve been in contact with an infected person, and you should also get tested. Public health departments have used contact tracing for decades to fight infectious disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Introducing <strong>California Connected</strong>, our state’s contact tracing program.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image text-center"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized">
    <img width="302" src="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/img/CAConnected_Logo_Tag_4C--en.png" alt="Connected California">
  </figure></div>



<p>Under this program, health workers will talk to those who have tested positive. They&#8217;ll alert anyone they may have exposed, keeping names confidential. They&#8217;ll check symptoms, offer testing, and discuss next steps like <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html">quarantine</a>, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/isolation.html">self-isolation</a> and medical care.</p>



<p>By finding spread patterns quickly, we slow infection and help avoid outbreaks. This lets California keep healthcare needs below capacity and safely reopen business.</p>



<h2>All you have to do is answer a phone call</h2>



<p>Contact tracing is an anonymous way to do your part. The more people answer the call, the more lives and jobs California saves. Your information is always kept confidential.</p>



<p>Early awareness helps you protect your friends and loved ones from exposure. And early medical care can improve your outcome.</p>



<p>The sooner we can reach you, the sooner you can get advice, testing, and support.</p>



<h2>How does contact tracing work?</h2>

<h3>If you test positive for COVID-19:</h3>



<ul><li>You will get medical care, regardless of income, health insurance, or immigration status.</li><li>You will get advice on how to separate yourself from others to avoid spreading the disease.&nbsp;</li><li>You will be asked basic questions like your name and age, the places you’ve been, and the people you’ve spent time with.</li><li>Those people will be contacted and told they may have been exposed to COVID-19. They will be offered testing and medical care.</li><li>Your personal information is confidential and will not be shared. They will not ask about your immigration status.</li></ul>



<h3>If you are exposed to COVID-19:</h3>



<ul><li>You’ll get a call, text or email from your local public health department to inform you of this exposure.</li><li>They will not share information about who may have exposed you. This information is confidential.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>You&#8217;ll get free, confidential testing, regardless of income, health insurance, or immigration status.</li><li>They will help you understand your infection risk. They&#8217;ll tell you what to do immediately to prevent further spread.</li><li>They will stay in touch to see if you develop symptoms.</li><li>If you have symptoms, they will get you tested quickly. You will get resources to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/isolation.html">self-isolate</a>.</li><li>They may ask questions about the places you’ve been and the people you’ve spent time with.</li><li>Your personal information is confidential and will not be shared. They will not ask about your immigration status.</li></ul>



<h2>Is the information I provide confidential?</h2>



<p>Yes. Your identity and health information is always kept private. It will not be shared with anyone who may have been exposed. No one will ask about your immigration status during testing, care or follow-up calls. You will never be asked for your Social Security number or payment information.</p>



<p>California’s strict privacy laws protect all your information. California Connected maintains data with strict privacy and security storage standards. The data is only collected and stored for use by local and state public health departments.</p>



<h2>Tips to protect others around you</h2>



<p>If you find out you have COVID-19 or tested positive for coronavirus, it&#8217;s important to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/isolation.html">isolate</a> yourself from others so they don&#8217;t get sick. Try to stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. Disinfect frequently-touched surfaces, or have your caregiver do so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People you live with are close contacts and should get tested.</p>



<h2>Support if you test positive</h2>



<p>Your <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/get-local-information/">local public health department</a> can connect you to </p>



<ul><li>Testing</li><li>Medical care</li><li>Housing if you need it to self-isolate.</li></ul>



<p>If you work, your employer may be required to provide you with paid sick leave. See this list of <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/pandemic/ffcra-employee-paid-leave">employee paid leave rights</a>, ensured by the federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA).</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">How do I become a contact tracer?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The initial phase of California Connected, the state’s contact tracing program, will utilize existing resources and redirect state employees to begin contact tracing efforts. Offers of additional support from the private sector and qualified members of the public are appreciated, but contact tracers from outside state government may not be needed until a future phase. Thank you for wanting to share your expertise and resources with your fellow Californians.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Is there extra sick leave available for workers who have COVID-19 symptoms or are waiting for test results?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. There are extra federal, state, and in some cases, local sick leaves available for people experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, seeking a medical diagnosis or in quarantine:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li><strong>Federal paid sick leave: </strong>Up to 80 hours under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (<a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/pandemic/ffcra-employee-paid-leave">FFCRA</a>) for businesses with less than 500 workers.&nbsp;See <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/pandemic/ffcra-questions">more information on FFCRA in its FAQs</a>.</li><li><strong>California COVID-19 supplemental paid sick leave:</strong>&nbsp;Food businesses with more than 500 workers must give up to 80 hours of <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/4.16.20-EO-N-51-20.pdf">paid sick leave</a>.&nbsp; See <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/FAQ-for-PSL.html">more information on supplemental paid sick leave</a>.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Local paid sick leave ordinances:</strong> Certain local areas also have paid sick leave ordinances.&nbsp; Consult with the local enforcement agency in your area.</li></ul>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I return to work once my isolation or quarantine is over?</h4>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">What steps are required when a business has an employee who tests positive?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If an employer discovers a worker has tested positive for COVID-19 or has symptoms, they should send the worker home. Then the employer should <a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/employer-playbook-for-safe-reopening--en.pdf">follow guidance</a> about isolation or quarantine, testing, and when it is appropriate for the worker to return to work. Employers should support the need for workers to stay home for the protection of others with flexible leave policies. For more details, see “What to do if there is a Case of COVID-19 in the Workplace” in the <a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/employer-playbook-for-safe-reopening--en.pdf">Employer Playbook for a Safe Reopening (PDF)</a> and check with your local health department.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can people who recover from COVID-19 be re-infected?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">We don’t yet know. The duration of immunity to coronavirus infection is not yet understood. Patients infected with other similar coronaviruses are unlikely to be re-infected in the months after they recover. However, more information is needed to know whether similar immune protection will be observed for patients with COVID-19.</p>
