<h2 id="care-through-telehealth">What care can you get through telehealth</h2>



<p>Many medical services can be provided through telehealth. They include:</p>



<ul><li>Screening for <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/#top">COVID-19 symptoms</a>, and determining if you need <a class="external" href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/Nearby/index.html?appid=43118dc0d5d348d8ab20a81967a1540">testing</a> or <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/treatment-for-covid-19/">treatment</a>. </li><li>Treatment for symptoms of other medical conditions or for follow-up care to treat ongoing conditions.</li><li>Treatment for a mental health or substance use issue, or are experiencing an emotional crisis or stress. <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/resources-for-emotional-support-and-well-being/">Mental health and substance use hotlines, crisis lines</a>, and other emotional support via phone are also available, as well as options through county programs, Medi-Cal, and private health insurance.</li></ul>



<h2 id="how-to-get-telehealth">How to get telehealth</h2>



<p>How you get telehealth depends on your health insurance.If you have regular <strong>Medicare, but are not enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan</strong>, visit the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/">healthcare and coverage page</a> to learn about options available to you.</p>



<p>If you have <strong>Medi-Cal</strong> (but are not enrolled in a Medi-Cal managed care health plan), or you <strong>do not have insurance</strong>, call Medi-Nurse, a 24/7 nurse advice line, at <a href="tel:1-877-409-9052">1-877-409-9052</a>. You can speak directly with a health professional about your symptoms, and get advice for further treatment in your area.</p>



<p>If you have <strong>private insurance, a Medi-Cal health plan, or a Medicare Advantage health plan</strong>, the simplest way to get treated over the phone is to call your doctor or regular provider.</p>



<p>If you do not have a regular doctor or your doctor isn’t available, you can use the <a href="#look-up-telehealth">search</a> below to find telehealth options offered by your plan through its member website. </p>



<p>If telehealth is not available from your doctor or your health plan, use the health plan’s nurse advice line included in the <a href="#look-up-telehealth">search</a> results.</p>



<p>You should not have to pay more for telehealth than you would for an in-person visit. Some health plans or providers may waive the copay.</p>



<h2 id="trouble-getting-telehealth">If you have trouble getting telehealth</h2>
