<p>If you’re having a medical emergency, you should call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room.</p>



<p>During this coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, the safest way to find out what medical care you may need is by phone or video while staying at home. This is called “telehealth.”</p>



<h2>Telehealth is the first step in getting medical care from home, including:</h2>



<ul><li>If you have <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/#top">coronavirus symptoms</a> and think you need <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/Nearby/index.html?appid=43118dc0d5d348d8ab20a81967a1540">testing</a> or <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/#top">treatment</a>. Many health care providers and health plans offer telehealth options for COVID-19 screening.</li></ul>



<ul><li>If you need treatment for symptoms of other medical conditions or for follow-up care to treat ongoing conditions.</li></ul>



<ul><li>If you need treatment for a mental health or substance use issue, or are experiencing an emotional crisis or stress. <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/resources-for-emotional-support-and-well-being/">Mental health and substance use hotlines, crisis lines, and other emotional support via phone</a> are also available to you, as well as options through county programs, Medi-Cal, and private health insurance.</li></ul>



<h2>How to get telehealth</h2>



<p>How you get telehealth depends on your health insurance.</p>



<h3>If you have regular Medicare, but are not enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan, please see <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/">the health care page</a>.</h3>



<h3>If you have Medi-Cal (but are not enrolled in a Medi-Cal managed care health plan), or you don’t have insurance:</h3>



<ul><li>Call “Medi-Nurse,” a 24/7 nurse advice line available at <strong><a href="http://tel[1-877-409-9052]">1-877-409-9052</a></strong>. You can speak directly with a health professional about your symptoms, and get advice for further treatment in your area.</li></ul>



<h3>If you have private insurance, a Medi-Cal health plan, or a Medicare Advantage health plan:</h3>



<ul><li>The simplest way to get treated over the phone is to call your doctor or regular provider.&nbsp;</li><li>If you don’t have a regular doctor or your doctor isn’t available, you can <strong>use the search below to find telehealth options offered by your plan</strong> through its member website. If telehealth isn’t available from your doctor or your health plan, please use the health plan’s nurse advice line included in the search results.</li><li>You should not have to pay more for telehealth than you would for an in-person visit. Some health plans or providers may waive the copay.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>What to do if you have trouble getting telehealth</strong></h2>



<p>If you have tried to get telehealth through your regular provider and health plan, and still have difficulty accessing services, you can call the following:</p>



<ul><li>For private health plans, call the state Department of Managed Health Care’s Help Center at <a href="http://tel[1-888-466-2219]">1-888-466-2219</a>.&nbsp;</li><li>For Medi-Cal, call the state Department of Health Care Service’s Help Center at <a href="http://tel[1-800-541-5555]">1-800-541-5555</a>.</li></ul>
