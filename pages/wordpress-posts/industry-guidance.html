<p>Before reopening, all facilities <strong>must:</strong></p>

This includes how to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsymptoms-testing%2Findex.html">screen themselves for symptoms</a> and when to stay home.</li><li>Set up individual control measures and screenings</li><li>Put disinfection protocols in place</li><li>Establish physical distancing guidelines</li></ol>
