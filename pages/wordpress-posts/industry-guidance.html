<p> As California reopens, every business will need to create a safer, low-risk environment. If you own or manage a business, follow the guidance below to protect your workers and customers.</p>



<h2>Reopen your business or facility safely</h2>



<p>Follow the <a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/employer-playbook-for-safe-reopening--en.pdf">Employer Playbook for a Safe Reopening</a> to help plan and prepare for reopening your business.</p>



<p>The playbook includes detailed information on:</p>



<ul><li>When and how an employer must report a COVID-19 positive employee.</li><li>What is defined as an outbreak.</li><li>Guidance for employers who may be considering whether to suspend operations due to COVID-19 spread in the workplace.</li></ul>



<p>Wearing a mask or face covering is required statewide in public or common spaces. Employers must provide face coverings to workers, or must reimburse workers for the reasonable cost of obtaining them. Find all requirements and exceptions to these rules in the guidance on this page below.</p>



<p>The industry-specific guidance applies to businesses statewide. All businesses and facilities <strong>must </strong>follow the items listed here before reopening: </p>



<ol><li><strong>Scroll down this page to find the guidance for your industry, business, event, or activity.</strong></li><li>Review it completely.</li><li>Perform a detailed risk assessment and create a worksite-specific protection plan.</li><li>Train employees on how to limit the spread of COVID-19. This includes how to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsymptoms-testing%2Findex.html">screen themselves for symptoms</a> and when to stay home.</li><li>Set up individual control measures and screenings.</li><li>Put disinfection protocols in place.</li><li>Establish physical distancing guidelines. </li><li>Establish universal face covering requirements (with allowed exceptions). See <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Guidance-for-Face-Coverings_06-18-2020.pdf">CDPH guidelines (PDF)</a>.</li><li>Post your completed checklist so everyone can know the steps you’ve taken. Feel free to add more safety measures to the ones included in your industry’s guidance.</li></ol>



<h2>More industries are open in certain counties</h2>



<p>Counties that have approval to do so can allow more businesses to open. Find the list of additional <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#county-attest">guidance for counties with attestations</a>.</p>



<h2>Industry closures</h2>



<h3>Statewide business closures</h3>



<p>Bars, pubs, brewpubs, and breweries must close all operations both <strong>indoor and outdoor statewide</strong>, unless they are offering sit-down, outdoor dine-in meals. Alcohol can only be sold in the same transaction as a meal.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>All counties</strong> must close <strong>indoor </strong>operations for the following business sectors: dine-in restaurants, wineries and tasting rooms, movie theaters and family entertainment centers (like bowling alleys, miniature golf, batting cages, and arcades), zoos and museums, and cardrooms.</p>



<h3>Closure of indoor operations for some businesses in certain counties</h3>



<p>Counties on the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/roadmap-counties/#affected-counties">County Monitoring List</a> must close <strong>indoor</strong> operations for the following business sectors, events, and activities:</p>



<ul><li>Gyms and fitness centers, like yoga and dance studios</li><li>Places of worship and cultural ceremonies, like weddings and funerals</li><li>Offices for non-essential (non-critical infrastructure) sectors</li><li>Personal care services, like nail salons and body waxing</li><li>Shopping malls</li><li>Hair salons and barbershops</li></ul>



<p>Shops that offer tattoos, piercings and electrolysis may <strong>not</strong> operate outdoors and must close.</p>



<h2>Employer policies and resources</h2>



<p>It’s important that employees with COVID-19 know they should stay home. Your sick leave policies need to support that. Workers also need safe and reliable childcare options during the COVID-19 response. See information on:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Comparison-COVID-19-Paid-Leave.html">Government programs supporting COVID-19 sick leave</a> and <a href="https://www.labor.ca.gov/coronavirus2019/#chart">workers’ compensation</a></li><li><a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-family-friendly-practices-employers--en.pdf">Family friendly practices for employers (PDF)</a></li><li><a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-support-working-families--en.pdf">Support for working families (PDF)</a></li><li><a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/childcare/#top">Find childcare</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Guidance-for-Face-Coverings_06-18-2020.pdf">CDPH guidance for the use of face coverings (PDF)</a></li></ul>
