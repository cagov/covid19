<p>California has a <a href="http://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy">Blueprint for a Safer Economy</a> in the state with revised criteria for loosening and tightening restrictions on activities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every county in California is assigned to a tier based on its rate of new cases and positivity. Check <a href="http://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy">your county’s tier status</a> to see how businesses and activities can open.</p>



<h2>Reopen your business or facility safely</h2>



<p>Use the <a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/employer-playbook-for-safe-reopening--en.pdf">Employer Playbook for a Safe Reopening</a> to help plan and prepare for reopening your business.</p>



<p>Review how to <a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/responding-to-covid19-workplace--en.pdf">respond to COVID-19 cases in your workplace</a> and prevent further spread.</p>



<p>Wearing a <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/#top">mask or face covering</a> is required statewide in public or common spaces. Employers must provide face coverings to workers, or must reimburse workers for the reasonable cost of obtaining them. Find all requirements and exceptions to these rules in the guidance on this page below.</p>



<p>All businesses and facilities <strong>must </strong>follow the items listed here before reopening: </p>



<ol><li><strong>Scroll down this page to find the guidance for your industry, business, event, or activity.</strong></li><li>Review it completely.</li><li>Perform a detailed risk assessment and create a worksite-specific protection plan.</li><li>Train employees on how to limit the spread of COVID-19. This includes how to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsymptoms-testing%2Findex.html">screen themselves for symptoms</a> and when to stay home.</li><li>Set up individual control measures and screenings.</li><li>Put disinfection protocols in place.</li><li>Establish physical distancing guidelines. </li><li>Establish universal face covering requirements (with allowed exceptions). See <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings.aspx">CDPH guidelines (PDF)</a>.</li><li>Post your completed checklist so everyone can know the steps you’ve taken. Feel free to add more safety measures to the ones included in your industry’s guidance.</li></ol>



<h2>Employer policies and resources</h2>



<p>It’s important that employees with COVID-19 know they should stay home. Your sick leave policies need to support that. Workers also need safe and reliable childcare options during the COVID-19 response. See information on:</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">A <strong>cohort</strong> is a stable group of no more than 14 children or youth and no more than two supervising adults in a supervised environment. The group stays together for all activities, including meals and recreation. And this group avoids contact with anyone not in their group.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Kids and adults in supervised care environments must be in groups as small as possible. Kids and supervising adults in one group must not physically interact with:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>kids and supervising adults in other groups</li><li>other facility staff</li><li>parents of kids in other groups</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Practicing a cohort structure:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>decreases opportunities for exposure to or transmission of the virus</li><li>facilitates more efficient contact tracing in the event of a positive case</li><li>allows for targeted testing, quarantine, and isolation of a single group instead of an entire population of kids and supervising adults</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/small-groups-child-youth.aspx">guidance related to cohorts</a> of children and youth sets minimum guidelines for providing specialized, targeted support services, necessary in-person child supervision and limited instruction, and facilitation of distance learning in small group environments in ways that maintain the focus on health and safety to minimize transmission. This guidance enables schools to provide specialized services for students with disabilities and English learners, and in-person support for at-risk and high-need students.&nbsp;</p>
