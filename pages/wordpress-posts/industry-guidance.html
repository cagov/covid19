<h2 id="protect-workers">Protect your workers</h2>



<h3>Prevent worker exposure to COVID-19</h3>



<p>Employers are required to follow California’s <a class="external" href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/ETS.html">COVID-19 prevention emergency temporary standards</a> &nbsp;to protect their workers and prevent exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace. Worker training must include the specific topics required by these standards. These standards are enforced by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health.</p>



<p>Visit the <a class="external" href="https://saferatwork.covid19.ca.gov/employers/">Employers</a> page of saferatwork.covid19.ca.gov to learn more about workplace requirements like:</p>



<ul><li>Safety procedures</li><li>Training for workers on infection prevention</li><li>What to do in case of an infection or outbreak&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Review <a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/responding-to-covid19-workplace--en.pdf">how to respond to COVID-19 cases</a> in your workplace and prevent further spread.</p>



<h3>Provide masks</h3>



<p>Wearing a <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/#top">mask or face covering</a> is required statewide in public or common spaces. Employers must provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers for the reasonable cost of obtaining them.

<h3>Paid leave and other benefits</h3>



<p>It’s important that employees with COVID-19 know to stay home. Your sick leave policies need to support that. Make sure your workers know about paid leave and other options available to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>See a <a class="external" href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Comparison-COVID-19-Paid-Leave.html">comparison of COVID-19 paid leave</a> available for workers affected by COVID-19.&nbsp;</li><li>Check the <a class="external" href="https://www.labor.ca.gov/coronavirus2019/#chart">chart of benefits</a> available to workers impacted by COVID-19.</li></ul>

This guidance includes practical steps your business can take to promote better ventilation, filtration, and air quality indoors to reduce the spread of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>
