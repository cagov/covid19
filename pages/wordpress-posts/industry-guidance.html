<p>As California <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/roadmap/">reopens</a>, every business will need to create a safer, low-risk environment. If you own or manage a business, follow the guidance below to protect your workers and customers.</p>



<p>The industry-specific guidance below applies to businesses statewide. Review the guidance that is relevant to your workplace, make a plan, and put it into action. Post your completed checklist so everyone can know the steps you’ve taken. Feel free to add more safety measures to the ones listed here. </p>



<p>Some counties have received state approval to move further into the reopening roadmap. Learn more and find related industry guidance on the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/roadmap-counties/">County Variance</a> page.</p>



<p>Before reopening, all facilities <strong>must:</strong></p>



<ol><li>Perform a detailed risk assessment and create a site-specific protection plan</li><li>Train employees on how to limit the spread of COVID-19. This includes how to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsymptoms-testing%2Findex.html">screen themselves for symptoms</a> and when to stay home.</li><li>Set up individual control measures and screenings</li><li>Put disinfection protocols in place</li><li>Establish physical distancing guidelines</li></ol>
