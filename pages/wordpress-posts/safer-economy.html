<h2 class="has-text-align-center" id="tier-assignments">Current tier assignments as of {{_varTierDate_}}</h2>



<p>Every county in California is assigned to a tier based on its positivity rate, adjusted case rate, and health equity metric. Counties must remain in a tier for at least 3 weeks before moving to a less restrictive tier. Counties must meet the next tier’s criteria for two consecutive weeks to move to a less restrictive tier. If a county’s metrics worsen for two consecutive weeks, it will be assigned a more restrictive tier.

<p>On March 12, 2021, California reached 2 million vaccination doses in the vaccine equity metric. New Blueprint tier assignments were announced and went into effect on March 14, 2021.</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center" id="reopening-safely">Reopening safely for all communities</h2>



<p>COVID-19 has impacted some communities more than others. Adults 65 and older, people with pre-existing health conditions, Latinos, Blacks, Pacific Islanders, people who are low-income, and our essential worker community all face higher rates of infection and death.</p>



<h4><strong>Key indicators that determine reopening</strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-table table-gridded"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Adjusted case rate</strong><br><strong>Daily new cases (per 100k)</strong></td><td>7-day average of daily COVID-19 cases per 100K with 7-day lag, adjusted for number of tests performed</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Positivity rate</strong></td><td>7-day average of all COVID-19 tests performed that are positive</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Health equity metric (Positivity rate for HPI quartile 1)</strong></td><td>7-day average of all COVID-19 tests performed that are positive for the lowest quartile, quartile 1, according to the Healthy Places Index</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Vaccines administered</strong></td><td>Number of vaccines doses administered statewide to people in the Health Places Index lowest quartile, quartile 1 (Vaccine Equity Metric)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h3 class="has-text-align-left">Health equity metric</h3>



<p>Counties must address COVID-19 in <strong>all</strong> communities to open further, including making sure the positivity rate in certain neighborhoods (health equity metric) does not significantly lag behind overall county positivity rates. These efforts need cross-sector and broad partnerships to succeed. The health equity metric is only used to decide whether a county can move to a less restrictive tier. Learn more about this <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/CaliforniaHealthEquityMetric.aspx">focus on equity</a>.</p>



<h3 class="has-text-align-left">Vaccine equity metric</h3>



<p>Forty percent (40%) of COVID-19 cases and deaths occur in California’s lowest Healthy Places Index (HPI) quartile. The <a href="https://healthyplacesindex.org/">Healthy Places Index</a>, developed by the Public Health Alliance of Southern California, helps us visualize community conditions such as low income, education completeness, and health care access. To end the pandemic, we’re setting aside forty percent (40%) of vaccines to distribute to people in HPI quartile 1. This approach will help lower the rate of community infection, hospitalization, and death. It will also help reduce potential new variants that might emerge. You can track the progress of vaccines administered to HPI quartiles on our <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/vaccines/#California-vaccines-dashboard">vaccine dashboard</a>.</p>



<p>We’ve met our goal of administering 2 million vaccine doses to the hardest-hit communities statewide. Because of this, the Blueprint for a Safer Economy tiers allow for somewhat higher case rates in the Substantial (red) tier. Learn more about these changes in CDPH’s Blueprint for a Safer Economy framework.</p>



<h3>How to move between risk levels</h3>



<p>There are two measures to determine how counties move through tiers: case rates and test positivity. We’ve been tracking these measures through regular progression and accelerated progression. To move to a higher tier with regular progression, a county must meet the case rate and test positivity thresholds for that tier for two consecutive weeks. Accelerated progression requires that test positivity and health equity metric are especially low with a declining case rate to move to a less restrictive tier. Read comprehensive detail about <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID19CountyMonitoringOverview.aspx">how counties can move through tiers</a>.</p>

<div class="matrix-holder"></div>
<p class="small-text">The positivity rate in the matrix above excludes people in state and federal prisons, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities, US Marshal detention facilities, and Department of State Hospitals facilities.</br>
*Small counties (those with a population less than 106,000) may be subject to alternate case assessment measures for purposes of tier assignment.<br>
**Health equity metric is not applied for small counties. The health equity metric is used to move to a less restrictive tier.</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center" id="blueprint-questions-and-answers">Questions and answers</h2>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Why can some activities and businesses open while others have to stay closed?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Activities and businesses that have a lower risk of spreading COVID-19 are allowed to open sooner. Higher-risk activities or businesses aren’t allowed until later tiers. An activity or business’s tier depends on whether it can:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Accommodate mask wearing at all times (for example, eating and drinking requires removing masks)</li><li>Allow physical distance between individuals from different households</li><li>Limit the number of people per square foot</li><li>Limit time that an individual is at the business or activity</li><li>Limit time of exposure</li><li>Limit mixing of people from different households</li><li>Limit amount of physical interactions of visitors/patrons</li><li>Increase airflow (such as operating outdoors or opening windows and doors)&nbsp;</li><li>Limit activities that are known to increase virus spread (like singing, shouting and heavy breathing)</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What happens if my county’s case rate and positivity measures fall into two different tiers?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If a county’s case rate and positivity rate fall into different tiers, the county remains in the stricter tier.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can my school open under the Blueprint for a Safer Economy?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">All K-6 grade schools are able to open for in-person instruction if the county case rate is below 25 per 100,000 and their plan for reopening is not found deficient by county health officials or the State Safe Schools Team. All schools are able to open for in-person instruction if the county is in the red, orange or yellow tiers.&nbsp; </p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">All public schools must offer in-person instruction under the <a href="http://cert1.mail-west.com/7Jyj7W/uzjanmc7rm/k36817Jgtmy/0gk2q/qvnq7Jddykx/817J/qo3iy3h2k1i56alg?_c=d%7Cze7pzanwmhlzgt%7C1865v1x2u3lv3bd&amp;_ce=1614969307.2f0bcbf94cf0f1ef3b6c085fb9534889">COVID-19 relief and school reopening relief package</a> for K-2 grades and students with high needs by March 31, 2021. Schools that do not offer in-person instruction for these groups by that date will lose 1 percent of eligible funds every day thereafter.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Schools in the Substantial (red) tier or better are required to offer in-person instruction to all students in all elementary grades and at least one middle or high school grade, or risk the same funding penalty.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">What can I do to help my county reach a lower tier?</h4>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Stay home except for essential needs.</li><li>Wear a mask in public.</li><li>Wash your hands regularly.</li><li>Keep at least six feet of physical distance when in public.</li><li>Limit mixing with people you don’t live with.</li><li><a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/vaccines/">Get vaccinated</a>.</li></ul>
