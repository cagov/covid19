<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><h4 class="alert-heading">New stay at home requirements for counties in the purple tier</h4><p>COVID-19 is increasing at alarming rates in California and we all need to do our part to stop the surge. As of November 21, 2020, it is required that all non-essential work and activities stop between 10PM and 5AM in counties in the Widespread (purple) tier.

<p>California has a blueprint for reducing COVID-19 in the state with revised criteria for loosening and tightening restrictions on activities.</p>



<cagov-reopening data-counties="data/reopening-counties.json" data-status="data/reopening-status.json" data-title="Find the status of activities in your county" data-county-restrictions-advice="Counties can restrict further. Check your local health department's website for local restrictions." data-industry-guidance-link-text="View industry guidance" data-view-all="View all" data-county-label="County"></cagov-reopening>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">Understand your county&#8217;s status</h2>



<p>Every county in California is assigned to a tier based on its test positivity and adjusted case rate.</p>



<p>In light of the recent, unprecedented surge in rate of increase of cases, the following changes are effective until further notice:</p>



<ul><li>Tier assignments may occur any day of the week and may occur more than once a week when the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) determines that the most recent reliable data indicate that immediate action is needed to address COVID-19 transmission in a county.</li><li>Counties may be moved back more than one tier if CDPH determines that the data supports more intensive intervention. Key considerations will include the rate of increase in new cases and/or test positivity, more recent data as noted below, public health capacity, and other epidemiological factors.</li><li>The most recent reliable data will be used to complete the assessment.</li><li>In light of the extreme circumstances requiring immediate action, counties will be required to implement any sector changes the day following the tier announcement.</li><li>Full details on the Blueprint are available in CDPH’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID19CountyMonitoringOverview.aspx">Blueprint for a Safer Economy framework</a>.</li></ul>



<h3 class="has-text-align-center">Reopening safely for all communities</h3>



<p>COVID-19 has impacted some communities more than others. They face higher rates of infection and death. These include our Latino, Black, Pacific Islander, low income, and essential worker communities.</p>



<p>Counties must address COVID-19 in <strong>all</strong> communities to open further, including making sure the positivity rate in certain neighborhoods (health equity metric) does not significantly lag behind overall county positivity rates. These efforts need cross-sector and broad partnerships to succeed. The health equity metric is only used to decide whether a county can move to a less restrictive tier.

<div class="matrix-holder"></div>
<p class="small-text">*Small counties (those with a population less than 106,000) may be subject to alternate case assessment measures for purposes of tier assignment.</br>
**Health equity metric is not applied for small counties. The health equity metric is used to move to a less restrictive tier.</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center">Questions and answers</h2>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Why can some activities and businesses open while others have to stay closed?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Activities and businesses that have a lower risk of spreading COVID-19 are allowed to open sooner. Higher-risk activities or businesses aren’t allowed until later tiers. An activity or business’s tier depends on whether it can:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Accommodate mask wearing at all times (for example, eating and drinking requires removing masks)</li><li>Allow physical distance between individuals from different households</li><li>Limit the number of people per square foot</li><li>Limit time that an individual is at the business or activity</li><li>Limit time of exposure</li><li>Limit mixing of people from different households</li><li>Limit amount of physical interactions of visitors/patrons</li><li>Increase airflow (such as operating outdoors or opening windows and doors)&nbsp;</li><li>Limit activities that are known to increase virus spread (like singing, shouting and heavy breathing)</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What happened to the County Monitoring List?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">On August 31, the Blueprint for a Safer Economy replaced the County Data Monitoring List for determining what business can and cannot open.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">So why change? We learned a lot over the first several months of the pandemic about COVID-19 and how it spreads. For example, we know how much safer outdoor activities are than indoor ones and that it’s critical everyone wears a mask to limit the spread of the disease. This blueprint incorporates what we’ve learned.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The Blueprint for a Safer Economy is the next evolution of our response. We’ve revised the criteria and the time between changing tiers. We&#8217;ve made it easy for counties to see how changes affect the disease’s trajectory and for businesses and customers to plan ahead. And we’ve given Californians one place to look up whether a business or activity is allowed near them.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What happens if my county’s case rate and positivity measures fall into two different tiers?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If a county’s case rate and positivity rate fall into different tiers, the county remains in the stricter tier.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can my school open under the Blueprint for a Safer Economy?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Schools in the Widespread (purple) tier aren’t permitted to reopen for in-person instruction, unless they receive a waiver from their local health department for grades TK-6. However, they may provide supervision of children in accordance with the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#cohort-guidance">cohorts guidance</a>.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Schools can reopen for in-person instruction once their county has been in the Substantial (red) tier for two weeks. Tiers take effect the day after assignment. For example, if a county moves to the Substantial (red) tier on Tuesday, September 8, and stays there for two weeks, schools can open Wednesday, September 23.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Schools that have reopened for in-person instruction are not required to close if their county moves back to the Widespread (purple) tier.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">What can I do to help my county reach a lower tier?</h4>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Wear a mask in public.</li><li>Wash your hands regularly.</li><li>Keep at least six feet of physical distance when in public.</li><li>Limit mixing with people you don’t live with.</li></ul>
