<p>As California reopens, every business will need to create a safer, low-risk environment. If you own or manage a business, follow the <a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/employer-playbook-for-safe-reopening--en.pdf">employer playbook</a> to help plan and prepare your business for reopening.

<h2>Questions and answers </h2>



<h3>Small Business Disaster Relief Loan Guarantee program</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What is a loan guarantee?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">A loan guarantee is a credit enhancement that helps mitigate the risk assumed by a lending institution when making a loan. With the Small Business Finance Center’s Disaster Relief Loan Guarantee Program, IBank agrees to guarantee up to 95% of the loan, removing the barriers to capital that often exist for small business borrowers that may not otherwise be eligible for traditional lending. This program also can assist those who may not be eligible for a U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) loan.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Who is eligible to apply for a loan guarantee?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Small business entities that have been affected by loss, damage or other economic injury due to the COVID-19 pandemic and meet the program’s eligibility requirements.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">The program will not accept an <strong>individual</strong> as the borrower.

It does not consider citizenship or immigration status for eligibility requirements<strong>,</strong> as long as the entity/individual meets the above criteria.
