<h2 id="questions-workers">Questions and answers</h2>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can routine travel for healthcare staff be covered under the “Hotel rooms for healthcare workers” program?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. Lodging for traveling healthcare providers should be accounted for in their contract through a stipend or in their hourly rate. The “Hotels rooms for healthcare workers” program shouldn’t be used to pay for those costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Traveling healthcare workers can access discounts provided by the program, but need to pay for the room on their own.</p>
