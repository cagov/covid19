<p class="blue-highlight">FEMA has approved this program for emergency, non-congregate sheltering. This program is a governmental effort to slow the spread of COVID-19. Under this program, eligible healthcare workers have a place to quarantine away from their household. This program has complete discretion in determining a participant’s eligibility and all aspects of the operation of the program. The program is not intended to create any rights or entitlement.</p>



<h3 id="discounted-rates"><strong><strong>Discounted hotel rates</strong></strong></h3>



<p>If you are not eligible for a state-paid hotel room, you may be able to get a discounted rate. You will still need to pay for your hotel room. This applies if you are:</p>



<ol><li>On travel status, or traveling from out of state</li><li>Work at an approved, certified facility more than 150 miles from your regular place of residence between shifts</li><li>Make $250,000 or more per year</li></ol>



<p>Discounted rates depend on the hotel.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" id="reserve-room"/>



<h2>Reserving a room</h2>



<p>Beginning January 12, 2021, all hotel reservations must be booked or approved by your facility’s Point of Contact. Ask your Human Resources or Benefits Office about your facility’s Point of Contact.</p>



<p>You have two ways to make a hotel reservation:</p>



<ol><li>Contact your facility’s Point of Contact to request approval</li><li>Call <a href="tel:877‑454‑8785">877-454-8785</a> and select option #2. Your request will be on hold until your Point of Contact approves it.</li></ol>



<p>Do not share your personal health information with anyone.</p>



<h3>Incidentals</h3>



<p>This program does not include extra services (sometimes called incidentals) from the hotel, such as food, room service, valet, parking, or laundry. You are responsible for incidentals.</p>



<h3><strong>Guest obligations</strong></h3>



<p>By participating in this program, you are agreeing to the <a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/hotel-rooms-for-healthcare-workers-guest-obligations--en.pdf">guest obligations</a> (updated 4/30/21). Violating these obligations may result in&nbsp;any or all of the following:</p>

<h2>Point of Contact for healthcare facilities</h2>



<p>Beginning January 12, 2021, each healthcare facility must maintain a Point of Contact to take part in this program.

This includes:</p>



<ul><li>Verifying that workers are actively employed at their facility</li><li>Determining whether workers are eligible</li><li>Submitting and approving requests for hotel reservations</li><li>Other program-related matters</li></ul>

<h2 id="questions-workers">Questions and answers</h2>



<h3 class="wp-accordion">Can routine travel for healthcare staff be covered under the “Hotel rooms for healthcare workers” program?</h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. Lodging for traveling healthcare providers should be accounted for in their contract through a stipend or in their hourly rate. The “Hotels rooms for healthcare workers” program shouldn’t be used to pay for those costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Traveling healthcare workers can access discounts provided by the program, but need to pay for the room on their own.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion">What if my facility’s Point of Contact rejects my reservation request?</h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you meet the program eligibility criteria, you can access discounts provided by the program, but will have to pay for the room on your own.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion">If I work for a staffing agency or registry, who will my Point of Contact be?</h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Your Point of Contact is the one for the healthcare facility you are working for. Staffing agencies and registries are not authorized to designate a Point of Contact.</p>
