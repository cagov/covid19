<h2 id="why-travel-is-risky">Why travel is risky</h2>



<p>When you travel, you spend more time outside your home and come into contact with people outside your household. You are near new people in airports, train stations, gas stations, grocery stores, restaurants, hotels, short-term rentals, sightseeing attractions, and retail stores. These new people may be exposing you to COVID-19, or you may be unknowingly exposing them. People arriving in California from other states or Californians returning from other states or countries could also introduce new sources of infection (potentially including new strains of the coronavirus) to California. This contributes to community spread of the disease, which leads to more illness and death.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Postponing travel and staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.</p>



<p>Read CDPH’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Travel-Advisory.aspx">Travel Advisory</a> for more information.</p>



<h2 id="whats-considered-essential-travel">What&#8217;s considered essential travel</h2>



<p>Some travel is considered essential and necessary. &#8220;Essential travel&#8221; is travel associated with the operation, maintenance, or usage of critical infrastructure or otherwise required or expressly authorized by law (including other applicable state and local public health directives), including:</p>



<ul><li>Critical infrastructure (like the water supply or power grid)</li><li>Economic services (like banking)</li><li>Supply chains (like food distribution)</li><li>Health care and immediate medical care</li><li>Safety and security</li><li>Work and study</li></ul>



<h2 id="current-travel-recommendations">Current travel recommendations</h2>



<p>Californians should remain local (not traveling more than 120 miles from their home or other place of residence) and avoid non-essential travel. Travelers from other states or countries entering into California for tourism and recreation are strongly discouraged.</p>

<h2 id="questions-and-answers">Questions and answers</h2>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Are there travel restrictions within California?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">On January 6, 2021, the California Department of Public Health issued a revised <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Travel-Advisory.aspx">Travel Advisory</a> that supersedes the previous Travel Advisory issued on November 13, 2020. This advisory affects all counties in California.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">To prevent further spread of COVID-19 and help contain any new sources of infection, Californians should stay within 120 miles from their home or other place of residence, unless they are traveling for essential purposes. Essential travel includes: work and study, critical infrastructure support, economic services and supply chains, health, immediate medical care, and safety and security.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Traveling into California from other states or countries for tourism or recreation is also strongly discouraged, and anyone traveling into California should self-quarantine for 10 days, unless quarantining is impracticable and the travel is for the sole purpose of meeting critical healthcare needs or other emergency response.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">See the California Department of Public Health’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Travel-Advisory.aspx">Travel Advisory</a> for more info.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>Do I need to self-quarantine when I arrive in California?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Traveling into California for tourism or recreation is strongly discouraged. If you do travel into California, you should <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/CDPH-Home-Quarantine-Guidance_9-16-2020.pdf">self-quarantine</a> for 10 days after you arrive, and should limit your interactions to people in your household. If you are traveling into California for essential purposes, you should still self-quarantine for 10 days and ensure you do not mix with others outside of those necessary to conduct your essential work. The only exception to the quarantine period is if you are in California to meet urgent critical healthcare needs or any other emergent response. In these cases, strictly adhere to <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings.aspx">face coverings</a> and physical distancing guidelines. </p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you routinely cross state or country borders for essential travel, and self-quarantine is impractical, you must still comply with all required guidance related to <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings.aspx">face coverings</a> and physical distancing to reduce the risk of spread of the virus.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I visit State Parks? What outdoor spaces are open?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Outdoor spaces, including state parks, <strong>may </strong>be open to facilitate physically distanced personal health and wellness through outdoor exercise. However, be sure to check the status of parks in your area before you travel as some State Parks may continue to be closed to help slow the spread of the virus.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">For information on National Parks, please the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/news/public-health-update.htm">National Park Service website</a>.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#campgrounds-outdoor-recreation">Outdoor playgrounds</a> may be open if they are free to enter and use and primarily serve nearby residents. Your local health department may have additional restrictions. Check <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/get-local-information/#County-websites">your county’s COVID-19 website</a> for information on playgrounds in your community.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Californians should not travel more than 120 miles from their home for non-essential purposes such as pleasure or recreation. If you do travel, take steps to keep everyone safe like wearing a face covering, keeping 6 feet of physical distance from those not in your household, and washing your hands frequently.</p>
