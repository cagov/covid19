<h2 id="whats-considered-essential-travel">What&#8217;s considered essential travel</h2>



<p>Some travel is considered essential and necessary. &#8220;Essential travel&#8221; is travel associated with the operation, maintenance, or usage of critical infrastructure or otherwise required or expressly authorized by law (including other applicable state and local public health directives), including:</p>



<ul><li>Critical infrastructure (like the water supply or power grid)</li><li>Economic services (like banking)</li><li>Supply chains (like food distribution)</li><li>Health care and immediate medical care</li><li>Safety and security</li><li>Work and study</li></ul>



<h2 id="why-travel-is-risky">Why travel increases risk</h2>



<p>When you travel, you spend more time outside your home and come into contact with people outside your household. You are near new people in airports, train stations, gas stations, grocery stores, restaurants, hotels, short-term rentals, sightseeing attractions, and retail stores. These new people may be exposing you to COVID-19, or you may be unknowingly exposing them. </p>



<p>People arriving from other states or Californians returning from other states or countries could also introduce new strains of the coronavirus to California, which leads to more illness and death. </p>



<p>Postpone non-essential travel until you are fully vaccinated to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Are there travel restrictions within California?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">On April 1, 2021, the California Department of Public Health issued a revised <a class="external" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Travel-Advisory.aspx">Travel Advisory</a> that supersedes the previous Travel Advisory issued on January 6, 2021. This advisory affects all counties in California.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">To prevent further spread of COVID-19 and help contain any new sources of infection, unvaccinated Californians should delay travel, unless they are traveling for essential purposes. Essential travel includes: work and study, critical infrastructure support, economic services and supply chains, health, immediate medical care, and safety and security.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Traveling into California from other states or countries for tourism or recreation is strongly discouraged. Anyone traveling into California should get tested before and after travel, and self-quarantine for 7 days if they have a negative COVID test result. If they weren’t tested, they should self-quarantine for 10 days.
