<h2 id="why-travel-is-risky">Why travel increases risk</h2>



<p>When you travel, you spend more time outside your home and come into contact with people outside your household. You are near new people in airports, train stations, gas stations, grocery stores, restaurants, hotels, short-term rentals, sightseeing attractions, and retail stores. These new people may be exposing you to COVID-19, or you may be unknowingly exposing them. </p>



<p>People arriving from other states or Californians returning from other states or countries could also introduce new sources of infection to California (including new strains of the coronavirus). This contributes to community spread of the disease, which leads to more illness and death.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Postponing non-essential travel and staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.</p>

<h2 id="questions-and-answers">Questions and answers</h2>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Are there travel restrictions within California?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">On April 1, 2021, the California Department of Public Health issued a revised <a class="external" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Travel-Advisory.aspx">Travel Advisory</a> that supersedes the previous Travel Advisory issued on January 6, 2021. This advisory affects all counties in California.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">To prevent further spread of COVID-19 and help contain any new sources of infection, Californians should delay travel outside of the state, unless they are traveling for essential purposes. Essential travel includes: work and study, critical infrastructure support, economic services and supply chains, health, immediate medical care, and safety and security.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Traveling into California from other states or countries for tourism or recreation is also strongly discouraged. Anyone traveling into California should self-quarantine for 7 days,&nbsp;if they have a negative COVID test result. If they weren’t tested, they should self-quarantine for 10 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
