<h2 id="protect-workers">Protect your workers</h2>



<h3>Prevent worker exposure to COVID-19</h3>



<p>Employers are required to follow CalOSHA’s <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/ETS.html">emergency temporary standards</a> to prevent exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace.</p>



<p>Visit the <a href="https://saferatwork.covid19.ca.gov/employers/">Employers</a> page of saferatwork.covid19.ca.gov to learn more about workplace requirements like:</p>



<ul><li>Safety procedures</li><li>Training for workers on infection prevention</li><li>What to do in case of an infection or outbreak&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Review <a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/responding-to-covid19-workplace--en.pdf">how to respond to COVID-19 cases</a> in your workplace and prevent further spread.</p>



<h3>Provide masks</h3>



<p>Wearing a <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/#top">mask or face covering</a> is required statewide in public or common spaces. Employers must provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers for the reasonable cost of obtaining them. Find all requirements and exceptions to these rules in the industry guidance for your business. For more about masks, check CDPH’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings.aspx">guidance for the use of face coverings</a>.</p>



<h3>Paid leave and other benefits</h3>



<p>It’s important that employees with COVID-19 know to stay home. Your sick leave policies need to support that. Make sure your workers know about paid leave and other options available to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>See a <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Comparison-COVID-19-Paid-Leave.html">comparison of COVID-19 paid leave</a> available for workers affected by COVID-19.&nbsp;</li><li>Check the <a href="https://www.labor.ca.gov/coronavirus2019/#chart">chart of benefits</a> available to workers impacted by COVID-19.</li></ul>



<h4>Childcare and family-friendly practices</h4>

This guidance includes practical steps your business can take to promote better ventilation, filtration, and air quality indoors to reduce the spread of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>

Follow the CDPH <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Use-of-Temporary-Structures-for-Outdoor-Business-Operations.aspx">guidance for temporary structures</a> to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.</p>
