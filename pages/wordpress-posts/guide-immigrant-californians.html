<p>If you’re an immigrant living in California, here is what you need to know to protect yourself, your family, and your community from coronavirus. Help and public benefits are available to you, some regardless of immigration status. </p>



<p><strong><strong>Don’t let fear stop you from getting necessary help or treatment</strong>, </strong>as the effects of avoiding health care services may be very serious. This will help keep you, your family, and your community healthy.</p>



<h2>Testing and treatment</h2>



<p>If you’re undocumented or don’t have insurance, you can still get needed COVID-19 testing and treatment at no cost. Medi-Cal care for COVID-19 related testing or treatment alone <strong>does not</strong> count under the public charge rule.</p>



<p>See <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/">who can get tested</a>.</p>



<h3 class="has-text-align-center">Uninsured? Have Medi-Cal, but no regular doctor? Call Medi-Nurse</h3>



<p>Medi-Nurse is a <a href="https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/Pages/DHCS-COVID%E2%80%9119-Medi-Nurse-Line.aspx">free, 24/7 nurse advice line</a> available at <a href="about:blank">1-877-409-9052</a>. You can speak directly with a health professional about your symptoms, get advice for further treatment in your area, or ask how to apply for health insurance.</p>

<h2>Hotel rooms for agricultural workers</h2>



<p>The Housing for the Harvest program offers temporary hotel housing to agricultural and food processing workers, including farm workers, who need to isolate due to COVID-19. It helps exposed agricultural workers protect their loved ones by giving them a place to stay and meals so they can self-isolate until they recover.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Tax Credits</h2>



<p>If you work and have low income, you may qualify for the California Earned Income Tax Credit (CalEITC). If you qualify for CalEITC and have a child under the age of six, you may also qualify for the Young Child Tax Credit (YCTC). These state credits can give you hundreds of dollars.</p>



<p>The CalEITC is now available to taxpayers who do not have a Social Security number, but do have an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN). If you have an ITIN and are eligible, you can claim the credit on your 2020 individual tax returns (which are filed in 2021). The Franchise Tax Board has more info on <a href="https://www.ftb.ca.gov/file/personal/credits/california-earned-income-tax-credit.html">CalEITC and YCTC</a> (<a href="https://www.ftb.ca.gov/file/personal/credits/california-earned-income-tax-credit-es.html">en Español</a>).</p>



<p>You may also be eligible for free tax preparation at a <a href="https://www.ftb.ca.gov/help/free-tax-help/VITA_Locator/">Volunteer Income Tax Assistance</a> site.</p>



<h2>Avoid utility power shut-offs</h2>



<p>Many utility companies are not shutting off services due to non-payment.</p>



<p>The Water Board restricts shut off to water services during the COVID-19 crisis. Please fill out this <a href="https://watershut-off.covid19.ca.gov/">form </a>to report any water shut off or reconnection issue. Language assistance is available (en español) for Spanish speakers to report water shut-offs by calling 916-445-5617.</p>



<h2>Disaster Relief Assistance for Immigrants</h2>
