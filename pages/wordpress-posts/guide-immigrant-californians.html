<p><strong>Effective July 29, 2020, a federal court ruling prohibits the application and enforcement of the public charge rule that went into effect on February 24, 2020. The ruling is currently in effect so long as there is a declared national emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic.</strong></p>



<p><strong>If you have questions about your specific case, please<a href="https://www.cdss.ca.gov/benefits-services/more-services/immigration-services/immigration-services-contractors/public-charge-contact-list"> consult qualified immigration assistance</a>.</strong></p>

<h2>Testing and treatment</h2>



<p><strong><strong>Don’t let fear stop you from getting necessary treatment</strong>, </strong>as the effects of avoiding health care services may be very serious. This will help keep you, your family, and your community healthy.</p>



<p>Regardless of changes to the public charge rule, if you’re undocumented or don’t have insurance, you can still get COVID-19 testing and treatment at no cost. Medi-cal care for COVID-19 related testing or treatment alone DOES NOT count under the public charge rule.</p>



<h4><strong>If you have Medi-Cal (but are not enrolled in a Medi-Cal managed care health plan), or you don’t have insurance:</strong></h4>



<p>Call “Medi-Nurse,” a 24/7 nurse advice line available at <a href="about:blank">1-877-409-9052</a>. You can speak directly with a health professional about your symptoms, get advice for further treatment in your area, or how to apply for health insurance.</p>
