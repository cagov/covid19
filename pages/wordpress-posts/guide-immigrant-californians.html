<h2 id="testing-treatment">Testing and treatment</h2>



<p><strong><strong>Do not let fear stop you from getting necessary help or treatment.</strong></strong> The effects of avoiding health care services can be serious. This will help keep you, your family, and your community healthy.</p>



<p>If you’re undocumented or don’t have insurance, you can still get needed COVID-19 testing and treatment at no cost. Medi-Cal care for COVID-19 testing or treatment alone <strong>does not</strong> count under the public charge rule.</p>



<p><a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/">Testing is available</a> to every Californian who needs it, including immigrants.</p>



<h3 class="has-text-align-center">Uninsured? Have Medi-Cal, but no regular doctor? Call Medi-Nurse</h3>

<h2 id="tax-credits">Tax credits</h2>



<p>If you work and have low income, you may qualify for the California Earned Income Tax Credit (CalEITC). If you qualify for CalEITC and have a child under the age of six, you may also qualify for the Young Child Tax Credit (YCTC). These state credits can give you hundreds of dollars.</p>



<p>The CalEITC is now available to taxpayers who do not have a Social Security number, but do have an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN). If you have an ITIN and are eligible, you can claim the credit on your 2020 individual tax returns (which are filed in 2021).
