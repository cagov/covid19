<p>California is protecting people experiencing homelessness during coronavirus and preventing others from losing their homes.</p>



<h2 class="js-qa-question">Help for renters, homeowners, and small landlords</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Factsheet-Tenant-Homeowner-and-Small-Landlord-Relief-and-Stabilization-Act-of-2020.pdf">Tenant, Homeowner and Small Landlord Relief and Stabilization Act of 2020</a> provides renters, homeowners, and small landlords with relief if coronavirus or the quarantine has impacted your ability to pay all or part of your rent or mortgage.</p>



<p>More information is available at <a href="https://landlordtenant.dre.ca.gov/">Housing is Key</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Renters</h3>



<p>An <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.30.20-EO-N-71-20.pdf">executive order</a> protects you from eviction if coronavirus or the quarantine impacted your ability to pay all or part of your rent between March 4, 2020, and August 31, 2020.</p>



<p>The Tenant, Homeowner and Small Landlord Relief and Stabilization Act protects you from eviction if you are unable to pay some or all of your rent due to coronavirus or the quarantine between September 1, 2020, and January 31, 2021. You’ll need to pay at least 25% of your rent for this period. You can do that monthly or in one lump sum by January 31, 2021.</p>



<p>In both situations, you must provide your landlord with a declaration of financial hardship. Make sure you:</p>



<ul class="js-qa-answer"><li>Explain your financial situation to your landlord and tell them how much you can pay&nbsp;</li><li>Save all financial documents&nbsp;</li><li>Pay as much of your rent as you can</li></ul>



<p class="js-qa-answer">If your landlord is attempting to evict you and you took all the above steps, contact a local legal aid provider and <a href="https://www.bcsh.ca.gov/coronavirus19/stabilization_act_guidance.pdf">learn about your protections</a>.</p>



<p class="js-qa-answer">Many utility providers are not shutting off services due to non-payment. Check with the <a href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/covid19protections/">California Public Utilities Commission</a> for more information.</p>



<h3>Homeowners and small landlords</h3>



<p>Foreclosure protection is available for homeowners and small landlords who have federally-backed mortgages through the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act. This includes landlords with four or fewer properties (whether or not they’re owner-occupied).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Homeowners or small landlords who don’t have federally-backed loans can contact their loan servicers to request forbearance. Your lender must provide detailed reasons if they deny your forbearance request. You can contest a denial.</p>



<p>These <a href="https://dbo.ca.gov/covid19-updates-fi/">financial institutions</a> may be able to reduce or delay your monthly payment. In addition, they will:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Give you a streamlined process to request forbearance for coronavirus-related reasons, supported with available documentation</li><li>Confirm approval of and terms of the forbearance program</li><li>Provide the opportunity to extend your forbearance agreement if you continue to experience hardship due to coronavirus</li></ul>
