<h2 class="h3 color-primary mt-0">Changes in Vaccination Data Reporting</h2>
<p>On June 16, the COVID-19 vaccination reporting system will track only two types of vaccinations&#8211;primary series and CDC&#8217;s new up-to-date measure. The reporting system will also stop publishing vaccination doses on hand information. <a class="button-lightblue font-size-1em" href="href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fvaccines%2Fdifferent-vaccines.html">See details on the new CDC measure</a> The reporting system will also stop publishing vaccination doses on hand information.

<h2>Vaccination status by Healthy Places Index and other groups</h2>



<p>This chart shows our progress in vaccinating groups and communities with the most urgent need. You can view by age, race and ethnicity, or Healthy Places Index (HPI), either statewide or by county.</p>



<p>This chart uses the Healthy Places Index 3.0 (HPI), developed by the Public Health Alliance of Southern California. The HPI uses a range of data sources and indicators to calculate a measure of community conditions ranging from the most to the least healthy based on economic, housing, and environmental measures. Scores range from less healthy community conditions in Quartile 1 to more healthy community conditions in Quartile 4.</p>
