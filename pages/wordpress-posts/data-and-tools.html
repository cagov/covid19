<p>Since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, California has had to face facts and make hard decisions. Defeating COVID-19 will require collaboration between state government, local governments, research universities, technologists, citizen scientists, and other members of the public.&nbsp;</p>



<p>California has collected a wide range of data to inform its response to COVID-19, and developed tools to help process and analyze that data. These data and tools are available for researchers, scientists, and technologists.</p>



<p>They’re available as a downloadable set, and in new models and dashboards.</p>



<h2>Data models</h2>



<p>The California COVID-19 Assessment Tool (CalCat) is a model to inform state and local response. You can find nowcasts, forecasts, and scenarios.&nbsp; </p>



<p>See the curve: <br><a href="https://calcat.covid19.ca.gov/">https://calcat.covid19.ca.gov</a></p>



<h2>Data dashboards</h2>
