<h2 id="In-daily-life">Why wear a mask</h2>



<p>Here are 3 reasons you might wear a mask:</p>



<ul><li>To protect yourself. The most protective masks against viruses like COVID-19 are N95, KN95, and KF94 masks that have <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Respiratory-Viruses/When-and-Why-to-Wear-a-Mask.aspx">good fit and filtration</a>. Masking in indoor public places is particularly important&nbsp;if you have an underlying health condition, are 50 or older, or have a weak immune system that increases <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/risks-getting-very-sick.html">your risk for severe COVID-19</a>. It&#8217;s also important to wear a mask if you are caring for someone who is sick.</li><li>To protect others. Wear a mask when you are sick and have symptoms of a respiratory infection. Masks are also important for protecting vulnerable people in high-risk settings.</li><li>To follow local requirements. Be sure to follow any local masking rules in effect. Your local community facility or health center can require it.</li></ul>
