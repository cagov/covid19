<h2 id="How-masks-help-stop-the-spread">How masks help stop the spread</h2>



<p>Coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs, sneezes, sings, talks, or breathes within 6 feet of others. You may be infected even if you feel well.</p>



<p><strong>To prevent infection, you must cover your nose and mouth when outside your home. </strong><a class="external" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings.aspx">Wearing a mask is required statewide</a>. It can slow the spread of COVID-19 by limiting the release of virus into the air. </p>



<p>Masks can reduce your exposure to infectious droplets through filtration. It also reinforces physical distancing, and shows you care about the health of others.</p>

<h3>Cloth masks</h3>



<div class="container py-4">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
     <p>Cloth masks can work well if they are tight-fitting and made of materials that filter out small particles.</p>
<p>Good cloth masks have:</p><ul>
      <li>Two layers of tightly woven cotton with a third layer of non-woven fabric. The third layer could be a mask filter insert, or a synthetic fabric such as polypropylene.</li>
    <li>Nose wires to reduce gaps around the nose</li>
    <li>Adjustable ear loops or headbands to reduce gaps around the face</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    </div>
 </div>
</div>



<p>Masks without these properties should not be used if other options are available.</p>



<p>Examples of less effective masks are:</p>



<ul><li>Two-layer cotton masks</li><li>Bandanas</li><li>Gaiters</li></ul>



<h3>Medical masks</h3>



<div class="container py-4">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
     <p>Medical masks (also called surgical masks) include many types of loose-fitting disposable masks. The fit of a medical mask can be improved with a simple <a class="external" href="https://youtu.be/UANi8Cc71A0">modification</a> or by using a <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/mask-fit-and-filtration.html#mask-fitters-braces">mask brace</a> <a>.</a></p>

<p>Buy medical masks with:</p>
<ul>
      <li>Three layers of non-woven material</li>
    <li>An adjustable nose bridge</li>
      </ul>
<p>Surgical masks with ties may provide a closer fit than ear loops.</p>

<h3>KN95 respirators</h3>



<p>KN95s are respirators made designed to provide a specific level of protection. But KN95 respirators have not gone through the same strict testing as N95s. </p>



<p>Testing of KN95s has shown that some models are not effective. If you do choose to use a KN95, we recommend finding a KN95 that has been <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/respirators/testing/NonNIOSHresults.html">tested by NIOSH</a> and has a minimum “filtration efficiency” of 95% or higher.</p>



<h3>N95 respirators</h3>



<div class="container py-4">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
     <p>When they fit well, N95 respirators are highly effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19. </p>
<p></p><p>Make sure they are <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/default.html" class="alert-link">NIOSH-approved</a> (have a TC-84A-XXXX number printed on the respirator). Choose a size and model that fits your face and has no gaps. Test it by doing a <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2018-130/pdfs/2018-130.pdf" class="alert-link">seal check</a> to make sure it fits. </p> <p></p>
    </div>
<div class="col-md-auto">

    </div>
 </div>
</div>



<p>As the availability of respirators increases, individuals may choose to wear them instead of other options, particularly in settings where greater protection is needed.</p>



<p>If you wear an N95 respirator, you should <strong>not</strong> wear an additional face covering over or under the respirator, as it can interfere with the seal to the face.</p>



<h2 id="How-to-wear-a-mask">How to wear a mask</h2>



<p>For your mask to be effective, it must be worn properly and consistently.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Wear your mask so it completely covers the nose and mouth</li><li>Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before putting on your mask</li><li>Put the mask over your nose and mouth and secure it under your chin</li><li>Fit the mask snugly against the sides of your face, slipping the loops over your ears or tying the strings behind your head</li><li>Make sure you can breathe easily</li><li>Try not to touch the mask when wearing it. This can transfer virus to your hands.</li><li>If you have to continually adjust your mask, it doesn’t fit properly. Try a different mask type or brand.</li></ul>



<p>The CDC has more information about <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-to-wear-cloth-face-coverings.html">how to wear masks</a>.</p>



<h2 id="Mask-fit-and-filtration">Mask fit and filtration</h2>



<p>An effective mask has both <strong>good fit</strong> and <strong>good filtration.</strong></p>



<h3>Good fit</h3>



<div class="container py-4">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
     <p>A well-fitted mask has no gaps between the face and mask, which can allow virus particles to leak in or out.</p>
<p>Good fit forces the air that you breathe out and breathe in to go through the mask and be filtered.
</p>
    </div>
<div class="col-md-auto">
      <img src="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/img/maskfitmatters.jpg" alt="Woman wearing an ill-fitting mask that gaps and lets unfiltered air in and out." style="width: 250px;">
<div class="caption">Example of a poorly-fit mask</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>



<h3><strong>Good </strong>filtration</h3>



<p>Good filtration blocks the virus particles from going through the mask itself. You can get good filtration with the right materials and by using more layers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Good fit and filtration improve protection for both you and others.</p>



<h3>Double masking</h3>



<p>“Double masking” is an effective way to improve fit and filtration. A close-fitting cloth mask can be worn on top of a surgical/disposable mask to improve the seal of the mask to the face.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Layering more than two masks is not recommended as this could be difficult to breathe through. It is also not recommended to wear two medical masks, or to wear a medical mask on top of a KN95 or an N95.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Double masking may be appropriate where improved fit and filtration are especially important.</p>



<h3>When fit and filtration is especially important</h3>



<p>Some situations require the higher level of protection you can get from good mask fit and filtration:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Indoor spaces with people from outside your household</li><li>Close quarters with other people where social distancing is not possible (examples: riding a crowded bus, waiting in line at a crowded airport terminal)</li><li>Any public place if you are <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/older-adults.html">older</a> or have medical conditions that put you at <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html">higher risk of severe COVID illness</a></li></ul>



<p>Even when you’re at home, there are times when a higher level of protection is important, such as when:</p>



<ul><li>Caring for family members who are sick or may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19</li><li>Living in a household with someone who has or may have COVID-19</li><li>Someone from outside your household comes into your home (like a friend, relative, or repair person)</li><li>You work outside the home and live with someone who is <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/older-adults.html">older</a> or has a medical condition that puts them at <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html">higher risk of severe COVID illness</a>.</li></ul>

<h3>Use masks even after you are vaccinated</h3>



<p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html">CDC recommends</a> wearing a mask even after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine to protect yourself and others. Experts are studying whether getting the vaccine will prevent you from spreading the virus to other people, even if you don’t get sick yourself. It’s important for everyone to continue using all the tools available to help stop this pandemic&nbsp;as we learn more about how COVID-19 vaccines work in real-world conditions.</p>



<h2 id="Mask-wearing-exceptions">Mask wearing exceptions</h2>



<p><strong>Individuals are excepted from wearing a mask when:</strong></p>



<ul><li>In a car alone or solely with members of their own household</li><li>Working in an office or in a room alone</li><li>Actively eating or drinking. You should maintain a distance of at least six feet from those not in your household.</li><li>Outdoors and maintaining at least 6 feet of social distance from others not in their household. You must have a face covering with you at all times and must put it on if you are within 6 feet of others who are not in your household.</li><li>Getting a service to the nose or face for which temporary removal of the mask is necessary</li><li>Your job requires you to wear respiratory protection</li><li>You are specifically exempted from wearing face coverings by <a class="external" href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/">industry specific guidance</a></li></ul>



<p><strong>Some people are exempt from wearing face coverings at all times:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Children younger than two years old, because they risk suffocation</li><li>Those with a medical condition, mental health condition, or disability that prevents wearing a face covering. This includes:<ul><li>Rare medical conditions for whom wearing a face covering could obstruct breathing</li><li>Being unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove a face covering without assistance</li></ul></li><li>Those who are hearing impaired, or communicating with a person who is hearing impaired. In these cases, the ability to see the mouth is essential for communication</li><li>Those for whom wearing a face covering would create a risk to the person related to their work</li></ul>



<p>Read the official<strong> </strong><a class="external" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings.aspx">mask guidance</a> from the California Department of Public Health.</p>



<h2 id="Questions-and-answers">Questions and answers</h2>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Should I wear a mask or face covering to protect against COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. You should wear masks or face coverings whenever you are outside of your home, unless one of the exceptions described by the state applies to you. Face coverings help reduce the spread of COVID-19. Masks can reduce your exposure to infectious droplets through filtration.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) has released <a class="external" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings.aspx">guidance for the use of face coverings</a>.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The guidance reminds Californians that the best defense against COVID-19 continues to be:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Maintain six feet of physical distance from others&nbsp;</li><li>Wash hands frequently</li><li>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands</li><li>Avoid being around people with COVID-19 symptoms</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What is a face covering?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">A face covering, also known as a cloth mask, is <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">material that covers the nose and mouth</a>. It can be secured to the head with ties or straps or simply wrapped around the lower face. It can be made of a variety of materials, such as cotton, silk, or linen. A face covering may be factory-made or sewn by hand, or can be improvised from household items such as scarfs, T-shirts, sweatshirts, or towels.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How well do face coverings prevent spread of COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Multi-layer cloth masks can both block up to 50-70% of fine droplets and particles, and limit the forward spread of those that are not captured. Their primary role is to reduce the release of infectious particles into the air when someone coughs, sneezes, sings, talks, or breathes. Cloth masks can also reduce your exposure to infectious droplets through filtration. Face coverings are not a substitute for physical distancing, washing hands, and staying home when ill, but complements them.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How should I care for a cloth mask or face covering?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It’s a good idea to <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">wash your face covering</a> frequently, ideally after each use. Have a bag or bin to keep face coverings in until they can be laundered with detergent and hot water and dried on a hot cycle. If you must re-wear your face covering before washing, wash your hands immediately after putting it back on and avoid touching your face. Discard face coverings that:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>No longer cover the nose and mouth</li><li>Have stretched out or damaged ties or straps</li><li>Cannot stay on the face</li><li>Have holes or tears in the fabric</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">See advice from the CDC on <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html">how to select, wear, and clean your mask</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Are face shields acceptable as face coverings to prevent spread of COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Face shields are not recommended as a substitute for masks or face coverings. They primarily provide eye protection for the person wearing it. It is unknown what level of protection a face shield provides to people nearby. </p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><a class="external" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/faceshield_handout.pdf">CDPH has detailed recommendations</a> for situations where face shields are the only option.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Should I wear a mask on public transportation and at transportation hubs?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/masks/mask-travel-guidance.html">CDC requires</a> all passengers and staff to wear masks while on public transportation or at boarding points. This includes airplanes, ships, ferries, trains, subways, buses, taxis, and ride-shares. Masks are also to be worn at transportation hubs and other locations where people board, like airports, bus or ferry terminals, train stations, and seaports. Rules on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html">what is an acceptable mask</a> apply.&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>People must wear masks when traveling into, within, or out of the United States on public conveyances.</li><li>Transportation staff will refuse to board anyone not wearing a mask. All people onboard, whether passengers or employees, must wear masks for the duration of travel, except:<ul><li>For brief periods while eating, drinking, or taking medication.</li><li>If the person is unconscious, incapacitated, unable to be awakened, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.</li><li>When it’s necessary to temporarily remove the mask to verify one’s identity such as during TSA screening or when asked to do so by the ticket or gate agent or any law enforcement official.</li><li>For children under the age of 2 years old.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Transportation staff will ensure that any person on the vehicle wears a mask when boarding, disembarking, and for the duration of travel.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">For more information, see the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/face-masks-public-transportation.html">CDC’s mask requirements for public transportation</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Is there any proof that masks are effective in preventing coronavirus infection?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. The CDC has collected evidence on the <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html">effectiveness of masks</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Masks create a barrier that helps prevent respiratory droplets from traveling into the air and onto other people when the wearer coughs, sneezes, talks, or raises their voice.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/masking-science-sars-cov2.html?fbclid=IwAR28PppCa6x2uxwO8Z2baHM0KHS4JXx0inzzMQs3zRHV1qql_0a8mxZfpCw">A mask also offers some protection to you</a>. How well it protects you from breathing in the virus likely depends on the fabrics used and how your mask is made (the type of fabric, the number of layers of fabric, how well the mask fits).</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You should wear a mask, even if you do not feel sick. This is because several studies have found that people with COVID-19 who never develop symptoms (asymptomatic) and those who are not yet showing symptoms (pre-symptomatic) can still spread the virus to other people. Wearing a mask helps protect those around you, in case you are infected but not showing symptoms.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It is especially important to wear a mask when you are indoors with people you do not live with and when you are unable to stay at least 6 feet apart since COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/appendix.html#contact">close contact</a> with one another.</p>
