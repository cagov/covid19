<p>Coronavirus spreads when an infected person speaks, sneezes, or coughs within 6 feet of others. You may have the virus and spread it even if you feel well.</p>



<p><strong>To prevent infection, you must cover your nose and mouth when outside your home. </strong>So wearing a mask is now required statewide.  Wearing a mask or cloth face covering can slow the spread of COVID-19 by limiting the release of virus into the air. It also reinforces physical distancing, and shows you care about the health of others.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Don’t wear your mask under your nose or just on your chin.</strong> </strong>A mask is only effective if it covers both ways you breathe.</p>

<p>See a <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Guidance-for-Face-Coverings_06-18-2020.pdf">complete list</a> of who should not wear a mask.</p>



<h2>When should you wear a mask?</h2>



<p>You should wear a mask or face covering whenever you’ll be around someone you don’t live with, including:</p>



<ul><li>In any indoor public space</li><li>When waiting in line</li><li>When getting health care</li><li>On public transportation or when ride-sharing</li><li>At work, when near others or moving through common areas&nbsp;</li><li>Outdoors, if you can’t stay 6 feet away from others</li></ul>



<h2>When can you take off your mask?</h2>



<p>There are times when it’s okay to take your mask off when you’re away from home, such as:</p>



<ul><li>When eating or drinking</li><li>If a hearing-impaired person needs to read your lips</li><li>If wearing a face covering imposes a risk to you at work &#8211; for example, if it could get caught in machinery</li><li>When you&#8217;re not sharing a common area, room or enclosed space with others</li><li>When you are getting a service to the nose or face</li><li>When outdoors in public and can stay six feet from others</li></ul>



<p>You should replace the mask as soon as you can after these activities to reduce the risk of infection.</p>



<h2>Kinds of masks</h2>



<p>There are many kinds of masks, but these are the 3 most common.</p>



<h3>Cloth mask or face covering</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="http://files.covid19.ca.gov/img/vera-davidova-I4WDjqFgHbE-unsplash.jpg" alt="Cloth mask or face covering" width="320" height="320" title="Cloth mask or face covering"/></figure>



<p>This is cloth used to cover the nose and mouth, tied behind the head, or secured over the ears with elastic loops. It is made of cotton, silk, linen, or neoprene, and can be machine-made or hand-sewn. A homemade version can be improvised from a scarf or t-shirt. It should be made of tightly woven fabric.</p>



<p>Most people should wear a cloth mask. This is so there can be enough surgical masks and N95 respirator masks for medical personnel.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Wearing a cloth face covering doesn’t take the place of physical distancing.</strong>&nbsp;</strong>It is effective when combined with keeping a 6-foot distance from others.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Use and care:&nbsp;</strong></strong>Wear a clean mask every time you go out. Wash in the laundry or by hand between uses. See more <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Guidance-for-Face-Coverings_06-18-2020.pdf">mask care instructions</a> from the&nbsp;California Department of Public Health.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Where to find:&nbsp;</strong></strong>Many online sellers now offer masks in a variety of materials. You can also make your own. Read how in this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">cloth mask guidance</a> from the CDC.</p>



<h3>Surgical mask</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="http://files.covid19.ca.gov/img/woman-in-white-face-mask-3873193.jpg" alt="Surgical mask" width="480" height="320" title="Surgical mask"/></figure>



<p>This is a manufactured disposable mask, often used in surgery. Medical personnel wear them for protection against fluid splashes.</p>



<p>Some non-medical workers also wear surgical masks for disposability and fluid protection. They include those who work in:</p>



<ul><li>Manufacturing</li><li>Food processing</li><li>Community/social services</li><li>Social work</li><li>In-home day care</li><li>Law enforcement/public safety</li><li>Schools</li></ul>



<p><strong><strong>Don’t buy surgical masks for personal use.</strong></strong>&nbsp;They are part of PPE needed by medical professionals.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Use and care:</strong>&nbsp;</strong>Start with a new mask every day. Replace and dispose of it according to your workplace guidelines.</p>



<p><strong><strong><strong>Where to find:&nbsp;</strong></strong></strong>If you are in one of the above industries, your employer must provide masks at work. If you’re a frontline employer and need to order them for your workers, see <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/request-ppe/">how to&nbsp;get PPE</a>.</p>



<h3>N95 respirator mask</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="http://files.covid19.ca.gov/img/15485_lores.jpg" alt="N95 respirator masks" class="wp-image-4827" width="525" height="350" title="N95 respirator masks"/></figure>



<p>This is a mask with a respirator that blocks 95% of particles that are otherwise inhaled. Medical personnel need them the most, but they’re used by some workers in other industries.</p>



<p><strong>Don’t buy N95 respirator masks for personal use.</strong>&nbsp;They are part of PPE needed by medical professionals.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><strong>Use and care:</strong>&nbsp;</strong>Start with a new mask every day. Replace and dispose of it according to your workplace guidelines.</p>



<p><strong><strong><strong>Where to find:&nbsp;</strong></strong></strong>If an N95 respirator mask is required for your job, your employer must provide them at work. If you’re a frontline employer who needs them for your workers, see <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/request-ppe/">how to&nbsp;get PPE</a>.</p>

<h2>Questions and answers</h2>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Should I wear a mask or face covering to protect against COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Californians must wear face coverings when in public spaces, especially indoors and other areas where physical distancing is not possible. Face coverings help reduce the spread of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) has released <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Guidance-for-Face-Coverings_06-18-2020.pdf">guidance for the use of face coverings</a>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The guidance reminds Californians that the best defense against COVID-19 continues to be:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Maintain six feet of physical distance from others&nbsp;</li><li>Wash hands frequently</li><li>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands</li><li>Avoid being around people with COVID-19 symptoms</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What is a face covering?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">A face covering, also known as a cloth mask, is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">material that covers the nose and mouth</a>. It can be secured to the head with ties or straps or simply wrapped around the lower face. It can be made of a variety of materials, such as cotton, silk, or linen. A face covering may be factory-made or sewn by hand, or can be improvised from household items such as scarfs, T-shirts, sweatshirts, or towels.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How well do face coverings prevent spread of COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">There is scientific evidence to suggest that use of masks or face coverings reduces disease transmission. Their primary role is to reduce the release of infectious particles into the air when someone speaks, coughs, or sneezes. Face coverings are not a substitute for physical distancing, washing hands, and staying home when ill, but complements them.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How should I care for a cloth mask or face covering?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It’s a good idea to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">wash your face covering</a> frequently, ideally after each use. Have a bag or bin to keep face coverings in until they can be laundered with detergent and hot water and dried on a hot cycle. If you must re-wear your face covering before washing, wash your hands immediately after putting it back on and avoid touching your face. Discard face coverings that:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>No longer cover the nose and mouth</li><li>Have stretched out or damaged ties or straps</li><li>Cannot stay on the face</li><li>Have holes or tears in the fabric</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">See advice from the CDC on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html">how to select, wear, and clean your mask</a>.</p>
