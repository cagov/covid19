<h2>Masking at work</h2>



<p>Cal/OSHA has aligned workplace mask requirements with general mask guidance from the CDPH.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Masks are strongly recommended indoors.</strong> Employers must document employees&#8217; vaccination status.<ul><li>There are some settings where masks are required regardless of vaccination status. In outbreaks, all employees must wear masks indoors and outdoors when six feet of physical distance cannot be maintained.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Masks are not required</strong> <strong>outdoors </strong>(except during outbreaks), regardless of vaccination status. Workers should be trained for outdoor use of face coverings.</li><li><strong>Employers must provide unvaccinated employees with NIOSH-certified respirator masks</strong> for voluntary use when:<ul><li>Working indoors, or </li><li>In a vehicle with others.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Unvaccinated workers must wear masks in state offices.</strong></li></ul>

<hr class="wp-block-separator" id="Guidance-for-businesses"/>



<h2>Guidance for businesses</h2>



<p>In settings where masks are still required, businesses, venue operators, or hosts may choose to:</p>



<ul><li>Provide information to all patrons, guests and attendees regarding vaccination requirements and <strong>allow individuals to self-attest</strong> that they are fully vaccinated or meet an <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/#Mask-wearing-exemptions">approved masking exemption</a> prior to entry.</li><li><strong>Implement vaccine verification</strong> to determine whether individuals are required to wear a mask.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Require all patrons to wear masks.</strong></li></ul>



<p>No person can be prevented from wearing a mask as a condition of participation in an activity or entry into a business.</p>

<h2>Questions and answers</h2>



<h3 class="wp-accordion">Which employers must require employees to wear masks under certain conditions?</h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/ETS.html">Cal/OSHA COVID-19 Prevention Emergency Temporary Standards</a> (ETS) applies to all employers, employees, and to all places of employment.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Unvaccinated workers must be provided respirators and are strongly encouraged to wear them in healthcare settings like hospitals and skilled nursing facilities, and they are required to wear surgical masks in high-risk congregate living settings and other healthcare settings such as homeless shelters and state and local correctional facilities and detention centers, as outlined in the <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Order-of-the-State-Public-Health-Officer-Unvaccinated-Workers-In-High-Risk-Settings.aspx">state public health officer order</a> of July 26, 2021.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">State employees who work on-site and are unvaccinated must also wear masks. This is outlined in <a href="https://www.calhr.ca.gov/Documents/Vaccine-Verification-and-Testing-Requirements.pdf">CalHR’s Vaccine Verification and Testing Requirements</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion">What are the mask requirements at workplaces?</h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/ETS.html">COVID-19 Prevention Emergency Temporary Standards</a> (ETS) requires employers to provide employees who are not fully vaccinated with NIOSH-certified respirator masks. They must ensure they are worn over the nose and mouth when indoors, in vehicles, and when required by orders from the CDPH. No employees need to use masks outdoors, regardless of vaccination status, unless there is an outbreak.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Order-of-the-State-Public-Health-Officer-Unvaccinated-Workers-In-High-Risk-Settings.aspx">state public health officer order</a> of July 26, 2021 requires unvaccinated employees in certain healthcare settings to be provided respirators, and requires unvaccinated employees in congregate living facilities and other healthcare settings to wear surgical masks at work. Congregate living facilities include adult and senior residential settings, homeless shelters, and state and local correctional facilities and detention centers.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><a href="https://www.calhr.ca.gov/Documents/Vaccine-Verification-and-Testing-Requirements.pdf">CalHR’s Vaccine Verification and Testing Requirements</a> say that state employees who work on-site and are unvaccinated must wear masks at work.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion">May an employer require an employee to wear a mask at work even if the employee provides documentation verifying that they are fully vaccinated?</h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, employers can have policies that are stricter than those required in the <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/ETS.html">Cal/OSHA COVID-19 Prevention Emergency Temporary Standards</a> (ETS). However, an accommodation must be made for those:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Who cannot wear face coverings due to a medical or mental health condition or disability</li><li>Who are hearing-impaired or communicating with a hearing-impaired person</li><li>When an employee performs specific tasks which cannot be performed with a face covering</li></ul>
