<h2 id="In-daily-life">When to wear a mask</h2>



<p>Californians should decide when and where to wear a mask based on COVID-19 community levels and other factors, such as your own personal risk of serious illness.</p>



<p>Here are 3 reasons you might wear a mask:</p>



<ul><li>Protect yourself. The most protective masks against viruses like COVID-19 are N95, KN95, and KF94 masks. Masks protect you if you have an underlying health condition, are 50 or older, or have a compromised immune system.</li><li>Protect others. Masks are still important for protecting vulnerable people in high-risk settings. Also, wear a mask if you are sick.</li><li>Follow local requirements. Be sure to follow any local masking rules in effect. Your local community facility or health center may require it.</li></ul>



<p>Masks are recommended for everyone when community levels of COVID-19 infections are higher.</p>

<strong>Regardless of COVID-19 community levels, masking is recommended:</strong>
<ul>
<li>If you have respiratory symptoms, such as a cough, runny nose, or sore throat </li>
<li>In indoor areas of public transportation, such as in airplanes and buses </li>
<li>For 10 days after having a significant exposure to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19</li>
<li>For 10 days after COVID-19 symptoms begin (or after testing positive if you don’t have symptoms)</li>
</ul>
