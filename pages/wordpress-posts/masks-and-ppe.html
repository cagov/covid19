<h2>In the workplace</h2>



<p>Cal/OSHA has aligned workplace mask requirements with general mask guidance from the California Department of Public Health.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Masks are not required</strong> <strong>outdoors </strong>(except during outbreaks), regardless of vaccination status, though workers should be trained for outdoor use of face coverings.</li><li><strong>Fully-vaccinated employees do not need to wear masks indoors</strong>, but employers must document their vaccination status.&nbsp;<ul><li>There are some settings where masks are required regardless of vaccination status. In outbreaks, all employees must wear masks indoors and outdoors when six feet of physical distance cannot be maintained, regardless of vaccination status.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Employers must provide unvaccinated employees with NIOSH-certified respirator </strong><strong>masks</strong> for voluntary use when working indoors or in a vehicle with others, upon request.</li></ul>
