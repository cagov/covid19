<h2 id="In-daily-life">Why wear a mask</h2>



<p>Here are 3 reasons you might wear a mask:</p>



<ul><li>To protect yourself. The most protective masks against viruses like COVID-19 are N95, KN95, and KF94 masks that have the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Get-the-Most-out-of-Masking.aspx" target="_blank">best fit</a> and filtration. Masking in indoor public places is particularly important if you have an underlying health condition, are 50 or older, or have a weak immune system.</li><li>To protect others. Wear a mask when you are sick and have symptoms of a respiratory infection. Masks are also important for protecting vulnerable people in high-risk settings.</li><li>To follow local requirements. Be sure to follow any local masking rules in effect. Your local community facility or health center can require it.</li></ul>



<p>Masks are recommended for everyone in indoor public settings when many in the community may currently have COVID-19 and be infectious to others. Please refer to your local health department for <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/state-dashboard/#county-statewide">local data</a>.</p>
