<h2><strong>Masks in the workplace</strong></h2>



<p>Cal/OSHA has aligned workplace mask requirements with general mask guidance from the CDPH.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Masks are not required</strong> <strong>outdoors </strong>(except during outbreaks), regardless of vaccination status. Workers should be trained for outdoor use of face coverings.</li><li><strong>Fully-vaccinated employees do not need to wear masks indoors.</strong> Employers must document employees’ vaccination status.&nbsp;<ul><li>There are some settings where masks are required regardless of vaccination status. In outbreaks, all employees must wear masks indoors and outdoors when six feet of physical distance cannot be maintained.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Employers must provide unvaccinated employees with NIOSH-certified respirator masks</strong> for voluntary use when:<ul><li>Working indoors, or&nbsp;</li><li>In a vehicle with others.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>For more information, see Cal/OSHA’s <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/ETS.html">COVID-19 Prevention Emergency Temporary Standards</a> (ETS).</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" id="Guidance-for-businesses"/>



<h2><strong>Guidance for businesses</strong></h2>



<p>In settings where masks are still required, businesses, venue operators, or hosts may choose to:</p>



<ul><li>Provide information to all patrons, guests and attendees regarding vaccination requirements and <strong>allow individuals to self-attest</strong> that they are fully vaccinated or meet an <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/#Mask-wearing-exemptions">approved masking exemption</a> prior to entry.</li><li><strong>Implement vaccine verification</strong> to determine whether individuals are required to wear a mask.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Require all patrons to wear masks.</strong></li></ul>



<p>No person can be prevented from wearing a mask as a condition of participation in an activity or entry into a business.</p>
