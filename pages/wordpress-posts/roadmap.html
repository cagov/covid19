<p>Californians have been staying home and saving lives since the start of our statewide stay-at-home order issued on March 19, 2020. These efforts have allowed the state to move forward on our <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Update-on-California-Pandemic-Roadmap.pdf">roadmap</a> for modifying the statewide order.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are now in early <strong>Stage 2</strong>, where retail (curbside and delivery only), related logistics and manufacturing,&nbsp;office workplaces, limited personal services, outdoor museums, child care, and <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/essential-workforce/">essential businesses</a> can open with modifications. The state is <a href="http://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance">issuing guidance</a> to help these workplaces reopen safely.</p>

<h2>County variance</h2>



<p>Stage 2 expansion will be phased in gradually. Some communities may move through Stage 2 faster if they are able to show greater progress. Counties that have met the readiness criteria and worked with the California Department of Public Health can open more workplaces as outlined on the <a href="http://covid19.ca.gov/roadmap-counties">County Variance page</a>.</p>



<h2>Industry guidance to reduce the risk</h2>



<p>California moved into Stage 2 of modifying the state’s Stay-at-Home order on May 8, 2020. Our progress in achieving key <a href="http://cert1.mail-west.com/ygO/7rmtB/tBgtmyuzjanmc/8t71/8l9ety77/5hq/2tBncv">public health metrics</a> will allow a gradual re-opening of California’s economy.</p>



<p>We recognize the impact of economic hardship. We must get our economy roaring once again and put paychecks in people’s pockets. But the risk of COVID-19 infection is still real for all Californians and continues to be fatal.</p>



<p>The state is <a href="http://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance">issuing guidance</a> for businesses to follow, if they’re permitted to open per County Public Health rules.</p>

<h2>Customers and individuals</h2>



<p>Customers and individuals are encouraged to stay home if they have a fever or other COVID-19 symptoms. Those with symptoms or elevated temperatures should not shop, get services in person, go to work, or gather with others. If you’re not sure if this applies to you, check your symptoms with this <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsymptoms-testing%2Findex.html">Symptom Screener</a>.</p>



<p>Higher risk individuals (over 65 or with serious medical conditions) should continue to stay home until Stage 4. Minimize errands by getting groceries delivered or asking for help from friends or family.</p>



<p><strong>Shop safely! </strong>Crowded settings increase your risk of exposure to COVID-19. Wear a face covering or cloth mask, stay 6 feet away from others, avoid touching your face, and wash your hands when you get home.</p>
