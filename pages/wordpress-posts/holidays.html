<p>As we celebrate the Year of the Ox, it&#8217;s important to protect our loved ones from COVID-19.&nbsp;One way to do that is to avoid in-person gatherings this Lunar New Year.</p>



<p>Please continue your family and cultural traditions, but: </p>



<ul><li>Limit the celebrations to those in your household and connect with others virtually</li><li>Wear a mask and stay 6 feet apart</li></ul>



<h2 id="the-covid-chat">Having &#8220;The COVID chat&#8221;</h2>



<h3>Do:</h3>



<ul><li>Be clear: Say &#8220;no&#8221; to anything that could increase risk for you or the people you care about</li><li>Offer alternatives: Ask if there’s another way to connect. Acknowledge you want to see them and find a different way to share the experience.</li><li>Drop off holiday meals for older loved ones and those with medical conditions, so they can stay home</li><li>Plan safe celebrations well in advance, then stick to the plan</li><li>Be honest: Remind people that you care about them and need to take precautions this year for everyone’s health</li></ul>



<h3>Don&#8217;t:</h3>



<ul><li>Plan celebrations with multiple households</li><li>Make someone feel guilty for not wanting to gather in person</li><li>Ridicule someone for wanting to take precautions</li><li>Feel pressured to take risks you’re not comfortable with</li><li>Forget to be compassionate, even when turning down an invitation</li><li>Miss connecting by phone or virtually with isolated or quarantined loved ones</li></ul>



<h2 id="restrictions">Check restrictions in your area</h2>



<p>Understand restrictions that may apply to you before you make plans.</p>



<ul><li>Read the <a title="go to About COVID-19 restrictions page" href="https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/">About COVID-19 restrictions</a> page to learn about public health orders in place.</li><li>Find out what <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/">businesses or activities are open</a> in your county.</li></ul>



<h2 id="travel-advisory">Travel advisory</h2>



<p>Traveling to see friends and family during holidays could increase your risk of infection and spread COVID-19 in your community. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In all regions, CDPH strongly recommends:</p>



<ul><li>Californians stay home or in their region and avoid non-essential travel.</li><li>Anyone arriving into California should voluntarily self-quarantine for 10 days.</li></ul>

<h2 id="holiday-tips">Tips for healthier holidays</h2>



<p>The spread of COVID-19 is increasing across the country and in California as colder weather drives more people indoors. To keep yourself and your loved ones safe, follow the guidelines applicable in your county. Here are some extra tips on how to celebrate the holidays more safely.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Check <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/">your county’s tier status</a></strong> to find out what types of activities and gatherings are permitted in your county based on the current spread of the virus.</li><li><strong>Wear a mask when you leave home</strong>, including on public and mass transportation, at events and gatherings, shopping and in stores, and anywhere you will be around people who do not live with you.</li><li><strong>Wear a mask around anyone you don’t live with</strong>.</li><li><strong>Keep your distance</strong> – especially from older family members and those with chronic health conditions.</li><li>If you are in a county where gathering is permitted, <strong>stay outdoors, keep it short, wear a mask,</strong> and <strong>maintain physical distancing</strong>.</li><li>If you are in a county where gathering is permitted, use all the space you can; <strong>spread things out</strong>.</li><li><strong>Don’t share utensils or drinks</strong> with anyone.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Commit to keeping gatherings short</strong>, whether inside or outside. Shorter (two hours or less) is safer.</li><li><strong>People at higher risk</strong> of severe illness or death from COVID-19 (such as older adults and people with chronic medical conditions) <strong>are strongly urged not to attend</strong> any gatherings, especially indoor gatherings. If you gather with older people or those with chronic conditions, make sure they wear a surgical or N95 mask.</li><li>It is safest to celebrate the holidays with the people who already live with you. If you do invite others,<strong> only invite a maximum of two other households</strong> to your gathering.&nbsp;</li><li>Travel increases your chance of getting and spreading the virus. <strong>Persons&nbsp;arriving in California from other states or countries, including returning California residents, should practice&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID-19-Quarantine.aspx" target="_blank">self-quarantine</a>&nbsp;for 10 days after arrival. </strong>These persons should limit their interactions to their immediate household.</li><li><strong>Wash your hands</strong> often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Stay home if you are sick.</strong></li></ul>
