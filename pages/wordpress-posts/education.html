<p>California has released <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/K-12-Guidance-2021-22-School-Year.aspx">guidance for K-12 schools</a> for the 2021-2022 school year. This updated guidance helps schools prepare for safe in-person instruction. It applies CDC’s latest recommendations to the conditions in California.</p>



<p>The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) continues to assess conditions on an ongoing basis. CDPH will determine by November 1, 2021 whether to update mask requirements.</p>
