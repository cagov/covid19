<h3 class="color-primary mt-0">Get information on safer school reopening</h3>
<p>An interactive reopening map is now available on the Safe Schools For All Hub. If you’re a school leader, staff, or parent, the schools hub now lists each school district’s current mode of instruction (in-person, hybrid, or distance learning) and links to its COVID safety plan. You can also get updated information from the Department of Public Health, request technical assistance, or submit your concerns.

<h3>Reopening safely</h3>



<p>California’s Safe Schools for All Plan will support schools to continue operating safely in-person and use a phased-in approach, rooted in science, to safely return younger students to in-person instruction. It will do this through a combination of funding, testing, PPE, safety guidance, and vaccines for school staff.</p>

<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>California has made $5.3 billion in investments to support safe reopening and rigorous distance learning.</li><li>Funds prioritize low-income students, English language learners, and special education students.</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What determines whether schools can open for in-person learning or continue distance learning?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">K-12th grade schools can reopen for in-person instruction in accordance with the <a href="https://schools.covid19.ca.gov/">K-12 School Guidance<span class="pdf-link-icon no-underline-icon" aria-hidden="true">PDF</span></a>. K-6th grade schools may open once their county has a case rate of less than 25 cases per 100,00 (adjusted) and if schools have followed the other processes for school re-opening outlined in the guidance. </p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Middle and High Schools can open once the county is in the Substantial (red) tier and have also followed the school re-opening guidance. The first day schools are eligible for re-opening under either criterion is the day after the county meets the relevant metric (case rate of less than 25, or being in the Substantial (red) tier) of the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/">Blueprint for a Safer Economy</a> (published weekly on Tuesdays, so schools are eligible to re-open on Wednesday). </p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Schools in counties that have met the relevant criteria for school re-opening per the K-12 Guidance have a three-week period to open, starting the day the county meets the criterion for re-opening, even if the county stops meeting the criterion during that window (i.e., case rate is ≥25 in a subsequent calculation or the county assignment goes back to the Widespread (purple) tier during the window). The goal of the three-week window is to facilitate calm and safe school re-openings.</p>
