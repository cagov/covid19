<h3>Reopening safely</h3>



<p>California’s Safe Schools for All Plan will support schools to continue operating safely in-person and use a phased-in approach, rooted in science, to safely return younger students to in-person instruction. It will do this through a combination of funding, testing, PPE, safety guidance, and vaccines for school staff.</p>
