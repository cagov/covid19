<p>The coronavirus outbreak has made it harder to get and afford groceries and prepared meals. If you or someone you know needs help getting food, here are some resources available to you.</p>



<h2>Emergency food and food benefits</h2>



<h3 class="js-qa-question">CalFresh food benefits</h3>



<p class="js-qa-answer">CalFresh provides food benefits to help people buy most foods at most grocery stores and farmers markets. People and families with low income can apply for CalFresh any time. If you have a change in income, even a temporary one because of the coronavirus, you can apply for CalFresh food benefits.</p>



<p class="js-qa-answer">To apply, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.getcalfresh.org/?source=cagov">CalFresh</a>&nbsp;online or call&nbsp;<strong><a href="tel:[1-877-847-3663]">1-877-847-3663</a> </strong>(<strong>1-877-847-FOOD</strong>). </p>



<p class="js-qa-answer">CalFresh benefits (sometimes called SNAP or food stamps) are issued on an EBT card each month. This card can be used to buy groceries online at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=19097785011&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=assocamazonops">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ideas/discover-grocery-pickup-delivery/walmart-grocery-pickup-accepts-snap-ebt-payments/355540">Walmart</a>. See <a href="https://www.cdss.ca.gov/Portals/9/CalFresh/EBTOnline/EBT-Online-FAQ-Sheet-En.pdf">frequently asked questions</a> about using EBT online.</p>



<h3 class="js-qa-question">Food banks</h3>

<h3 class="js-qa-question">Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) food benefits</h3>



<p class="js-qa-answer">WIC helps families get access to healthy foods and a lot more. WIC provides nutrition education, breastfeeding support, and benefits for healthy foods. WIC can also help with finding health care and other community services.</p>



<p class="js-qa-answer">WIC serves babies and children up to age 5, pregnant women, and new mothers. Parents, grandparents, foster parents, or guardians can enroll children up to their 5th birthday. Working families and migrant families are welcome to apply too.</p>



<p class="js-qa-answer">If you recently lost your job because of the coronavirus, you can apply for WIC. You can also apply if your income has changed or you are unable to work, even temporarily due to COVID-19. <strong>Find out if you qualify&nbsp;at <a href="http://www.myfamily.wic.ca.gov/">MyFamily.WIC.ca.gov,</a> or call <a href="tel:1-888-942-9675">1-888-942-9675</a> (1-888-WIC-WORKS)</strong> for more information. WIC locations have procedures to get you WIC benefits quickly, even when closed to the public. Please call before visiting.</p>



<h2>Families with school-aged children</h2>



<h3 class="js-qa-question">School meals and the ‘CA Meals for Kids’ app</h3>



<p class="js-qa-answer">The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/03/13/governor-newsom-signs-executive-order-ensuring-state-funding-for-schools-even-in-event-of-physical-closure/">governor’s executive order</a>&nbsp;ensures public schools will retain full funding.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/schooldirectory">Check your local school district</a>&nbsp;for more information on how and where to receive free or reduced-cost school meals.</p>



<p class="js-qa-answer">The CA Meals for Kids app can help students and families find meals during COVID-19 emergency school closures.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="js-qa-answer">The app is free and can be downloaded from&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ca-meals-for-kids/id1327449394">Apple’s App Store</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.ca.cde.NSDMobileApp">Google’s Play Store</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ca-meals-for-kids/9p7t6j276zz9">Microsoft’s App Store</a>.</p>



<h3 class="js-qa-question">Pandemic EBT (P-EBT)</h3>



<p class="js-qa-answer">Families with children who are eligible for free or reduced-price meals at school can get extra benefits to help buy food when schools are closed due to COVID-19. These food benefits are called Pandemic EBT or P-EBT. Families can use P-EBT benefits to buy food at most grocery stores and farmers markets, and to buy groceries online at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/snap-ebt/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=19097785011&amp;nocache=1588651384818">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ideas/discover-grocery-pickup-delivery/walmart-grocery-pickup-accepts-snap-ebt-payments/355540">Walmart</a>.</p>



<p class="js-qa-answer">Families can get up to $365 for each child who is eligible for P-EBT benefits. The total amount depends on how many eligible children are living in your home. Students can still pick up to-go meals even if they are receiving P-EBT benefits.</p>



<p><strong>Note: </strong>New applications for P-EBT are no longer being accepted as of July 15, 2020. Due to the high volume of people who need help during the pandemic, applications filed before that date will still be processed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you applied before July 15, you can visit the <a href="https://ca.p-ebt.org/en/info#APPLICATION_STATUS">Application status</a> section on the P-EBT website for more information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you haven’t received your P-EBT card yet, you may need to update your current address. Visit the <a href="https://ca.p-ebt.org/en/info#HELP">Help section</a> on the P-EBT website to find out what you can do.</p>
