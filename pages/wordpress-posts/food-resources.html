<p>The coronavirus outbreak has made it harder to get and afford groceries and prepared meals. If you or someone you know needs help getting food, here are some resources available to you.</p>



<h2><strong>Emergency food and food benefits</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>CalFresh food benefits</strong></h3>



<p>CalFresh (sometimes called SNAP or food stamps) issues monthly food benefits on an EBT card that can be used to buy most foods at most grocery stores and farmers markets. People and families with low income can apply for CalFresh any time. If you have a change in income, even a temporary one because of the coronavirus, you can apply for CalFresh food benefits.</p>



<p>To apply, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.getcalfresh.org/?source=cagov">CalFresh</a>&nbsp;online or call&nbsp;<strong><a href="tel:[1-877-847-3663]">1-877-847-3663</a> </strong>(<strong>1-877-847-FOOD</strong>). </p>



<p>Beginning April 28, people getting CalFresh food benefits can <a href="https://www.cdss.ca.gov/ebt-online">use their EBT card to buy groceries</a> online at Amazon and Walmart statewide. See <a href="https://www.cdss.ca.gov/Portals/9/CalFresh/EBTOnline/EBT-Online-FAQ-Sheet-En.pdf">frequently asked questions about using EBT online</a>.</p>



<h3><strong><strong>Food banks</strong></strong></h3>

<h3><strong>Pandemic EBT (P-EBT)</strong></h3>



<p>Families with children who are eligible for free or reduced-price meals will get extra food benefits to help buy food when schools are closed due to COVID-19. These food benefits are called Pandemic EBT or P-EBT benefits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Families can get up to $365 for each child who is eligible for P-EBT benefits. The total amount depends on how many eligible children are living in your home. Students can still pick up to-go meals even if they are receiving P-EBT benefits.</p>



<p>Pandemic EBT (P-EBT) benefits will be available for eligible families starting May 2020.</p>



<ul><li>Families with children who get CalFresh, Medi-Cal, or Foster Care benefits do not need to apply. Most families will get their P-EBT card in the mail during the month of May.</li><li>Families with children who applied for CalFresh, Medi-Cal, or Foster Care benefits after their school closed will get their P-EBT card in the mail before June 30, 2020.&nbsp;</li><li>Families with children who are eligible for free or reduced-price meals and who do not get CalFresh, Medi-Cal, or Foster Care benefits must apply online before June 30, 2020.
