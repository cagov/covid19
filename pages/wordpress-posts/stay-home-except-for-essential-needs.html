<p>All individuals living in the State of California are currently ordered to stay home or at their place of residence, except for <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/roadmap/">permitted work</a>, local shopping or other permitted errands, or as otherwise authorized (including in the Questions &amp; Answers below).</p>



<p>On March 19, 2020, an <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.19.20-attested-EO-N-33-20-COVID-19-HEALTH-ORDER.pdf">Executive Order (PDF)</a> and <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Health%20Order%203.19.2020.pdf">Public Health Order (PDF)</a> directed all Californians to stay home except to go to an essential job or to shop for essential needs.</p>



<p>On May 4, 2020, an <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.4.20-EO-N-60-20.pdf">Executive Order (PDF)</a> informed local health jurisdictions and industry sectors that they may gradually reopen under new modifications and guidance provided by the state per the May 7, 2020 <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/SHO%20Order%205-7-2020.pdf">Public Health Order (PDF)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="faq">Questions and answers</h2>



<h3>What is the relationship between the order and these questions and answers?</h3>



<p>The Governor has ordered Californians to obey the directives of the State Public Health Officer. Those directives take many forms; they include specific materials linked on this page, as well as these questions and answers. These questions and answers are directives from the State Public Health Officer, and have the same force and effect as other State Public Health Officer directives.</p>



<h3>When does the stay home order go into effect and how long will we stay home? What areas of the state are covered?</h3>



<p>The order went into effect on Thursday, March 19, 2020. The order is in place until further notice. It covers the whole state of California.</p>



<p>As of May 8, the stay home order was modified. In addition to essential activity,  retail is allowed, along with the infrastructure to support it. As of May 12, offices, limited services, and outdoor museums are also permitted to open.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Is it safe to shop at open businesses?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The risk of COVID-19 infection is still real for all Californians and continues to be fatal. That is why every business permitted to open should take every step humanly possible to reduce the risk of infection by following these <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/roadmap/">state guidelines</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can the Order be changed?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. The State Public Health Officer may issue new orders as the public health situation changes.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How does this order interact with local orders to shelter in place? Does it supersede them?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">This is a statewide order. Counties may move further into the Resilience Roadmap if they meet certain criteria.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">If I am not an Essential Critical Infrastructure Worker, can I still leave the house?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. As described in more detail elsewhere in applicable state public health directives (including on this page), there are a wide range of circumstances in which you may leave your home or other place of residence, even if you are not an Essential Critical Infrastructure Worker. For example, you may leave your home to work at any business or other entity that is allowed to open, to patronize local businesses, or to care for friends or family members who require assistance (as set forth below). And errands like these are not the only reasons you may leave your home: you may also leave your home with or without a specific destination in mind (for example, to walk your dog, to engage in physical recreation, or simply to get some fresh air) as long as you maintain physical distancing and <strong>do not gather with any number of people who are not members of your household.</strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Are mass gatherings permitted?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">State public health directives prohibit professional, social and community mass gatherings. Gatherings are defined as—meetings or other events that bring together persons from multiple households at the same time for a shared or group experience in a single room, space, or place such as an auditorium, stadium, arena, large conference room, meeting hall, or other indoor or outdoor space. They pose an especially high danger of transmission and spread of COVID-19.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">On May 25, 2020, in an effort to balance First Amendment interests with public health, the State Public Health Officer created an exception to the prohibition against mass gatherings for faith-based services and cultural ceremonies as well as protests. Those types of gatherings are permitted so long as they do not exceed 100 attendees or 25% of the capacity of the space in which the gathering is held, whichever is lower. All other mass gatherings are prohibited until further notice.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I get a haircut?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It depends. If your county has been approved to move further in the Resilience Roadmap, then hair salons and barber shops may reopen in your area. See the list of <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/County_Variance_Attestation_Form.aspx">counties with a variance</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I visit my family and friends?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It is best to stay connected with your loved ones through phone and video calls, as visiting family and friends outside your household still presents a risk of spreading coronavirus. Keeping distance from others is especially important for people that are at higher risk of getting very sick, including older people, and people of any age who have underlying medical conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you do visit family or friends that don’t live in your home in person, take steps to keep everyone safe, like:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Keep at least 6 feet between yourself and others, even when you wear a face covering</li><li>Visit outdoors instead of indoors when possible</li><li>Wear a face covering or cloth mask</li><li>Wash your hands often</li><li>Clean and disinfect commonly- touched surfaces</li></ul>



<h3 class="h2" id="political">Protected activities</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong><strong>I want to express my political views.&nbsp; How can I make my voice heard?</strong></strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">There are many ways for you to express your political views without holding a physical, in-person gathering.&nbsp; For example, you may continue to call or write elected officials, write letters to the editor of news publications, display lawn or window signs, or use online and other electronic media (including Zoom rooms, Twitter feeds, Facebook pages, and other digital forums) to express your views.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Additionally, as noted above, you may leave your home for any reason as long as you <strong>do not gather with people who are not members of your household</strong>.&nbsp; When you are otherwise out in public, public health directives do not prevent you from engaging in political expression—such as by wearing or carrying a sign.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If collective action in physical space is important to you, consider whether you and other participants can safely protest from within your cars.&nbsp; The State Public Health Officer does not consider in-car protests to be gatherings, if participants stay in their cars and otherwise remain apart from individuals who are not part of their households.&nbsp; Many activists have organized car-based protests (honking horns, flying flags, displaying signs, and so on) to express their political views while complying with State public health directives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Whenever you are considering a protest (including an in-car protest), make sure you comply with all other applicable laws, including any local public-health measures that may be more restrictive than statewide directives and any other applicable local laws.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you do wish to engage in in-person protest outside of your car with a group of any size, you must follow the guidelines for political protest gatherings below.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I engage in political protest gatherings?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, although in-person protests present special public health concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Even with adherence to physical distancing, bringing members of different households together to engage in in-person protest carries a higher risk of widespread transmission of COVID-19. &nbsp;Such gatherings may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities like chanting, shouting, singing, and group recitation negate the risk-reduction achieved through six feet of physical distancing. For this reason, people engaging in these activities should wear face coverings at all times. </p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Therefore, it is strongly recommended that those exercising their right to engage in political expression (including, for example, their right to petition the government) should utilize alternative channels, such as the many online and broadcasting platforms available in the digital age, in place of in-person gatherings.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">However, state public health directives do not prohibit in-person <em>outdoor</em> protests as long as physical distancing of six feet between persons or groups of persons from different households is maintained at all times. Additionally,&nbsp;Local Health Officers are advised to consider appropriate limitations on outdoor attendance capacities, factoring their jurisdiction&#8217;s key COVID-19 health indicators. Failure to maintain adequate physical distancing may result in an order to disperse or other enforcement action.&nbsp;Masks and cloth face coverings are strongly recommended.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">State public health directives do not prohibit in-person&nbsp;<em>indoor</em> protests as long as&nbsp;(1) attendance is limited to 25% of the relevant area’s maximum occupancy, as defined by the relevant local permitting authority or other relevant authority, or a maximum of 100 attendees, whichever is lower, and (2)&nbsp;physical distancing of six feet between persons or groups of persons from different households is maintained at all times.&nbsp;Failure to maintain adequate physical distancing may result in an order to disperse or other enforcement action.&nbsp;Masks and cloth face coverings are strongly recommended.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Participants must maintain a physical distance of six feet from any uniformed peace officers and other public safety personnel present, unless otherwise directed, and follow all other requirements and directives imposed by local health officers and law enforcement, or other applicable authorities.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">This limitation on attendance will be reviewed at least once every 21 days. This review will assess the impacts of these imposed limits on public health and provide further direction as part of a phased-in restoration of gatherings that implicate the First Amendment.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How do I vote?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Elections are an essential activity, and the <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/05/08/governor-newsom-issues-executive-order-to-protect-public-health-by-mailing-every-registered-voter-a-ballot-ahead-of-the-november-general-election/">Governor has issued executive orders to ensure elections are safe and accessible</a>. Vote-by-mail ballots will be sent to all registered voters for the November 3, 2020 General Election. Additionally, many in-person voting opportunities will be available: counties are required to provide <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/06/03/governor-newsom-signs-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-accessible-general-election-in-november/">three days of early voting</a> starting the Saturday before the election, and open ballot drop-box locations between October 6 and November 3, 2020. The Secretary of State and the California Department of Public Health are working on additional guidance to ensure that all Californians are able to participate in elections safely. Except where suspended by Executive Order, existing laws addressing the use of vote-by-mail ballots in California elections remain in effect.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Of course, whenever you engage in any permissible activity—including the collection and drop-off of ballots, or other election-related activities (such as the collection of signatures to qualify candidates or measures for the ballot)—adhere to physical distancing and other applicable public health directives.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>Can I go to church?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. As of May 25, places of worship such as churches, mosques, temples, and synagogues can open throughout the state, with <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-places-of-worship.pdf">modifications for safety (PDF)</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I practice my religious faith?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Practicing your faith is a constitutionally-protected activity and may manifest in many different forms.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Although in-person religious gatherings—like other in-person gatherings—have been restricted to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, on May 25, 2020, the State Public Health Officer began to ease restrictions on in-person religious gatherings. In particular, the State Public Health Officer now authorizes County Departments of Public Health to allow collective activities at places of worship, subject to conditions to support a safe, clean environment for employees, interns and trainees, volunteers, scholars, and all other types of workers as well as congregants, worshippers, and visitors.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What conditions must be met to resume religious services at places of worship?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Information on conditions imposed by the state can be found at <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-places-of-worship.pdf">guidance for places of worship (PDF)</a>. Additional conditions may be imposed by local public health officials. This guidance does not obligate places of worship to resume in-person activity. It is strongly recommended that places of worship continue to facilitate remote services and other alternatives to in-person religious practice for those who are vulnerable to COVID19.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Even with adherence to physical distancing, convening in a congregational setting of multiple households to practice a personal faith carries a higher risk of widespread transmission of COVID-19, and may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities like singing and group recitation dramatically increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission. For this reason, congregants engaging in singing, particularly in the choir, and group recitation should wear face coverings at all times.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Places of worship must therefore limit&nbsp;<em>indoor&nbsp;</em>attendance to 25% of building capacity or a maximum of 100 attendees, whichever is lower. Local Health Officers are advised to consider appropriate limitations on&nbsp;<em>outdoor&nbsp;</em>attendance capacities, factoring their jurisdiction&#8217;s key COVID-19 health indicators. At a minimum, outdoor attendance should be limited naturally through implementation of strict physical distancing measures of a minimum of six feet between attendees from different households, in addition to other relevant protocols within this document. </p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">This limitation will be in effect for the first 21 days of a county public health department’s approval of religious services and cultural ceremonies activities at places of worship within their jurisdictions.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can children attend group activities (like Sunday school or Hebrew school) at places of worship?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">At this time, no. Children should remain in the care of those in their household unit and not interact with children of other parties at all times while visiting facilities. Places of worship must discontinue activities and services for children (for example, shared play areas) where physical distancing of at least six feet cannot be maintained.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">When will these conditions change for places of worship?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Every 21 days, the California Department of Public Health, in consultation with county Departments of Public Health, will review and assess the impacts of these imposed limits on public health and provide further direction as part of a phased-in restoration of activities in places of worship. This is because COVID-19 has an incubation period of 14 days; the 21-day interval accounts for this incubation period and provides for an additional seven days for thorough review, analysis, and preparation of modifications.</p>



<h3 class="h2" id="outdoor">Outdoor recreation</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I still exercise? Take my kids to the park for fresh air? Take a walk around the block?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It’s okay to go outside to go for a walk, to exercise, and participate in healthy activities as long as you <strong>maintain a safe physical distance of six feet and gather only with members of your household.</strong> You can also participate in activities at <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-campgrounds.pdf">outdoor recreational facilities</a> that are allowed to open. <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/public-recreation/">Parks may be closed</a> to help slow the spread of the virus. Check with local officials about park closures in your area. Californians should not travel significant distances for recreation and should stay close to home. </p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Below is a list of some outdoor recreational activities.</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Badminton (singles)</li><li>Throwing a baseball/softball</li><li>BMX biking</li><li>Canoeing (singles)</li><li>Crabbing</li><li>Cycling</li><li>Exploring rock pools</li><li>Gardening (not in groups)</li><li>Golfing (doubles, only if cart has protective partition)</li><li>Hiking (trails/ paths allowing distancing)</li><li>Horse riding (singles)</li><li>Jogging and running</li><li>Kite boarding and kitesurfing</li><li>Meditation</li><li>Outdoor photography</li><li>Picnics (with your household members only)</li><li>Quad biking</li><li>Rock climbing</li><li>Roller skating and rollerblading</li><li>Rowing (singles)</li><li>Scootering (not in groups)</li><li>Skateboarding (not in groups)</li><li>Soft martial arts – tai chi, chi kung (not in groups)</li><li>Surfing</li><li>Tennis and table tennis (singles)</li><li>Throwing a football, kicking a soccer ball (not in groups)</li><li>Trail running</li><li>Trampolining</li><li>Tree climbing</li><li>Volleyball (singles)</li><li>Walk the dog</li><li>Wash the car</li><li>Watch the sunrise or sunset</li><li>Yoga</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I walk my dog? Take my pet to the vet?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You can walk your dog. You can go to the vet or pet hospital if your pet is sick. Remember to distance yourself at least six feet from other pets and owners.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I visit State Parks? What outdoor spaces are open?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">State Parks, campgrounds, museums, and visitor centers <a href="https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=30350">may continue to be closed</a> to help slow the spread of the virus. Starting June 12, some counties may open campgrounds and RV parks. Be sure to check <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/public-recreation/">parks in your area before you travel</a>. Californians should not travel significant distances for pleasure or recreation and should stay close to home. If you do travel, take steps to keep everyone safe like wearing a face cloth covering, keeping 6 feet of physical distance from those not in your household, and washing your hands frequently.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You can walk, run, hike and bike in your local neighborhoods as long as they continue to practice physical distancing of 6 feet. This means avoiding crowded trails &amp; parking lots. </p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">For information on National Parks, please the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/news/public-health-update.htm">National Park Service website</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>Can I travel?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You can travel for urgent matters or if such travel is essential to your permitted work. Even though businesses around the state are opening up, avoid travelling long distances for vacations or pleasure as much as possible. This is to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Do not travel if you are sick, or if someone in your household has had coronavirus in the last two weeks. Do not travel with someone who is sick. </p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Before travelling away from your community, consider these questions from the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-in-the-us.html">Center for Disease Control (CDC) travel guidance</a>:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Is coronavirus spreading where you are traveling?</li><li>Are you or those you are traveling with more likely to get very sick from coronavirus?</li><li>Will you be able to keep 6 feet of physical distance from others during or after your trip?</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you do travel, take steps to keep everyone safe like wearing a face cloth covering, keeping 6 feet of physical distance from those not in your household, and washing your hands frequently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="h2" id="govservices">Government services</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I go to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Beginning June 11, <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/news-and-media/dmv-reopens-remaining-field-offices-to-public/">all DMV offices</a> are open to the public to help with appointments that require an in-person visit.

<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>Can I get my smog checked?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The <a href="https://www.bar.ca.gov/COVID-19_Impacts_on_BAR_Programs_and_Services.aspx">Bureau of Automotive Repair</a> advises drivers to still pay DMV vehicle registration fees to avoid any late fees. However, you will not receive your new registration or year sticker until the smog information has been received by DMV. Once state and local orders or directives are no longer in effect, consumers can then obtain the required smog check certificate to complete the DMV vehicle registration process.</p>
