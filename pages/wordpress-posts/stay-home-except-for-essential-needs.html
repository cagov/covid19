See the <a href="/essential-workforce/">full list of exempt sectors</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">My school is providing free grab-and-go meals and childcare. Are those still open?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. It is essential to keep children fed and educated. School employees should report to work and focus on distance learning, school meals, and childcare/supervision.</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Daycares are still open, but only for children of parents working in essential sectors.

<h3 class="h2" id="health">Health care and helping sick relatives</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What if I need to visit a health care provider?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you are feeling sick with flu-like symptoms, please first call your doctor, a nurse hotline, or an urgent care center.&nbsp;<br><br>If you need to go to the hospital, call ahead so they can prepare for your arrival. If you need to call 911, tell the 911 operator the exact symptoms you are experiencing so the ambulance provider can prepare to treat you safely.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What about routine, elective or non-urgent medical appointments?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Preventive care services and non-emergency surgeries, like organ replacements and tumor removals, can take place if hospitals have enough capacity and protective equipment to do so safely. Eye exams, teeth cleanings, and elective procedures should be cancelled or rescheduled. If possible, health care visits should be done remotely. Contact your health care provider to see what services they are providing.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I still go out to get my prescriptions?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. You may leave your home to obtain prescriptions or get cannabis from a licensed cannabis retailer.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How can I make sure the older Californians in my life are safe and healthy during the stay home order?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You should check in on your older neighbors and loved ones with a call, text or physically distanced door knock to make sure they are okay. You can also teach them how to FaceTime, Zoom, Google Duo or use Facebook video to communicate. The most important thing you can do is to keep in touch with older loved ones for their mental health and safety.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">I am an older Californian who is isolating at home and I need non-urgent assistance. What can I do?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You can call the statewide hotline for older Californians <a href="tel:1-833-544-2374">1-833-544-2374</a> for your non-urgent medical needs, to get meals delivered, track down prescriptions and more. The most important thing you can do is stay home for your health and wellbeing. If you are experiencing an emergency please call 9-1-1.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I leave home to care for my elderly parents or friends who require assistance to care for themselves? Or a friend or family member who has disabilities?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Be sure that you protect them and yourself by following social distancing guidelines such as washing hands before and after, using hand sanitizer, maintaining at least six feet of distance when possible, and coughing or sneezing into your elbow or a tissue and then washing your hands. If you have early signs of a cold, please stay away from your older loved ones.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I visit loved ones in the hospital, nursing home, skilled nursing facility, or other residential care facility?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Generally no. There are limited exceptions, such as if you are going to the hospital with a minor who is under 18 or someone who is developmentally disabled and needs assistance. For most other situations, the order prohibits non-necessary visitation to these kinds of facilities except at the end-of-life. This is difficult, but necessary to protect hospital staff and other patients.</p>
