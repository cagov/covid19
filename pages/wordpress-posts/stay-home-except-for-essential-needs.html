<h2 id="faq">Questions and answers</h2>



<h3>What is the relationship between the order and these questions and answers?</h3>



<p>The Governor has ordered Californians to obey the directives of the<br>State Public Health Officer. Those directives take many forms; they<br>include specific materials linked on this page, as well as these questions<br>and answers. These questions and answers are directives from the<br>State Public Health Officer, and have the same force and effect as other<br>State Public Health Officer directives.</p>



<h3>When does the stay home order go into effect and how long will we stay home? What areas of the state are covered?</h3>



<p>The order went into effect on Thursday, March 19, 2020. The order is in place until further notice. It covers the whole state of California.</p>



<p>As of May 8, the stay home order was modified. We are now in the first phase of <strong>Stage 2</strong>. This means in addition to essential activity, curbside retail is allowed, along with the infrastructure to support it. As of May 12, offices, limited services, and outdoor museums are also permitted to open.</p>



<p>Six key health and scientific&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/04/14/governor-newsom-outlines-six-critical-indicators-the-state-will-consider-before-modifying-the-stay-at-home-order-and-other-covid-19-interventions/" target="_blank">indicators</a>&nbsp;will be considered before modifying the state’s stay home order to allow additional Stage 2 activity.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What’s open?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Essential services that protect public health, public safety, and provide essential needs will remain open, such as:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Gas stations&nbsp;</li><li>Pharmacies</li><li>Food: Grocery stores, farmers markets, food banks, convenience stores, take-out and delivery restaurants&nbsp;</li><li>Banks&nbsp;</li><li>Laundromats/laundry services&nbsp;</li><li>Essential state and local government functions will also remain open, including law enforcement and offices that provide government programs and services.</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Businesses in a number of other sectors can now also open, with necessary modifications.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong>Retail</strong></p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Retailers, shopping malls, and libraries can re-open for delivery or curbside pickup, along with the manufacturing and logistics sectors that support retail. Drive-in movie theaters can re-open with additional considerations. Retail does not include personal services such as beauty salons but does include the sale of goods, such as:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Bookstores</li><li>Jewelry stores</li><li>Toy stores</li><li>Clothing and shoe stores</li><li>Home and furnishing stores</li><li>Sporting goods stores</li><li>Florists</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong>Offices</strong>&nbsp;(in all sectors, not only critical infrastructure)</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong>Limited Services</strong>&nbsp;which do not generally require close customer contact, such as:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Pet grooming</li><li>Dog walking</li><li>Car washes</li><li>Appliance repair</li><li>Residential and janitorial cleaning</li><li>Plumbing</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong>Outdoor Museums</strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What’s closed?</h4>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Dine-in restaurants&nbsp;</li><li>Bars and nightclubs&nbsp;</li><li>Entertainment venues&nbsp;</li><li>Gyms and fitness studios&nbsp;</li><li>Public events and gatherings&nbsp;</li><li>Convention centers</li><li>Hair and nail salons</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Is it safe to shop at these businesses?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The risk of COVID-19 infection is still real for all Californians and continues to be fatal. That is why every business permitted to open should take every step humanly possible to reduce the risk of infection by following these <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/roadmap/">state guidelines</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can the Order be changed?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. The State Public Health Officer may issue new orders as the public health situation changes.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How does this order interact with local orders to shelter in place? Does it supersede them?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">This is a statewide order. Counties may open additional Stage 2 sectors more quickly if they meet certain criteria.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">If I am not an Essential Critical Infrastructure Worker, can I still leave the house?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. As described in more detail elsewhere in applicable state public<br>health directives (including on this page), there are a wide range of<br>circumstances in which you may leave your home or other place of<br>residence, even if you are not an Essential Critical Infrastructure Worker.<br>For example, you may leave your home to work at any business or other<br>entity that is allowed to open, to patronize local businesses, or to care for<br>friends or family members who require assistance (as set forth below).<br>And errands like these are not the only reasons you may leave your<br>home: you may also leave your home with or without a specific<br>destination in mind (for example, to walk your dog, to engage in physical<br>recreation, or simply to get some fresh air) as long as you maintain<br>physical distancing and <strong>do not gather with any number of people who<br>are not members of your household.</strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I organize a gathering, such as a party or a protest?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The California Department of Public Health has determined that all<br>public gatherings with people who are not members of your household<br>—in any indoor or outdoor space—should be postponed or canceled to<br>curb community spread of COVID-19. State agencies are not issuing<br>permits for any gatherings—of any size, or any kind—at this time.<br>Gatherings will be permitted again once public health officials determine<br>they can be conducted in a manner consistent with public health and<br>safety. In the meantime, please postpone or cancel your gathering, and<br>consider whether you can find alternative ways to host your event that<br>do not require an in-person, physical gathering.</p>



<h3 class="h2" id="political">Political activity</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">I want to express my political views. How can I make my voice heard?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">There are many ways for you to express your political views without holding a physical, in-person gathering. For example, you may continue to call or write elected officials, write letters to the editor of news publications, display lawn or window signs, or use online and other electronic media (including Zoom rooms, Twitter feeds, Facebook pages, and other digital forums) to express your views.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Additionally, as noted above, you may leave your home as long as you <strong>do not gather with people who are not members of your household</strong>.&nbsp; When you are otherwise out in public, public health directives do not prevent you from engaging in political expression—such as by wearing or carrying a sign—as long as you do not hold a gathering of any size, and otherwise maintain physical distancing.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If collective action in physical space is important to you, consider whether you and other participants can safely protest from within your cars. The State Public Health Officer does not consider in-car protests to be prohibited gatherings, if participants stay in their cars and otherwise remain apart from individuals who are not part of their households.&nbsp; Many activists have organized car-based protests (honking horns, flying flags, displaying signs, and so on) to express their political views while complying with State public health directives.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Whenever you are considering a protest (including an in-car protest), make sure you comply with all other applicable laws, including any local public health measures that may be more restrictive than statewide directives and any other applicable local laws.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How do I vote?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Elections are an essential activity, and the <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/05/08/governor-newsom-issues-executive-order-to-protect-public-health-by-mailing-every-registered-voter-a-ballot-ahead-of-the-november-general-election/">Governor has issued executive orders to ensure elections are safe and accessible</a>. Vote-by-mail ballots will be sent to all registered voters for the November 3, 2020 General Election. The Secretary of State and the California Department of Public Health are working on additional guidance to ensure that all Californians are able to participate in elections safely. Existing laws address the use of vote-by-mail ballots in California elections, and those laws remain in effect unless otherwise noted.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Of course, whenever you engage in any permissible activity—including the collection and drop-off of ballots, or other election-related activities—be mindful of physical distancing and other measures to protect yourself and those around you.</p>



<h3 class="h2" id="business">Business and taxes</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Do I need to pay my taxes?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, <a href="https://www.ftb.ca.gov/about-ftb/newsroom/news-releases/2020-3-state-postpones-tax-deadlines-until-july-15-due-to-the-covid-19-pandemic.html">state</a> and <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-day-now-july-15-treasury-irs-extend-filing-deadline-and-federal-tax-payments-regardless-of-amount-owed">federal</a> deadlines have been extended and are now due on July 15. </p>



<h3 class="h2" id="school">Schools and childcare</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">My school is providing free grab-and-go meals. Are those still available?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. It is essential to keep children fed and educated. </p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I get child care during the stay home order?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, all child care facilities can open with necessary modifications. See the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/childcare/">Child care page</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can my babysitter still come to the house?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, a child care worker can come to your home if necessary and should adhere to basic prevention guidelines (e.g. handwashing for at least 20 seconds, physical distancing, staying home if feeling ill).</p>



<h3 class="h2" id="health">Health care and helping sick relatives</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What if I need to visit a health care provider?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you have <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/#top">coronavirus symptoms</a>, please contact your doctor through <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/telehealth/">telehealth</a> or use the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsymptoms-testing%2Findex.html">Symptom Screener</a> self-checker.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you have other illnesses or chronic conditions, use <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/telehealth/">telehealth</a> to get care from home.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you need to go to the hospital, call ahead so they can prepare for your arrival. If you need to call 911, tell the 911 operator the exact symptoms you are experiencing so the ambulance provider can prepare to treat you safely.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What about routine, elective or non-urgent medical appointments?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Preventive care services and non-emergency surgeries, like organ replacements and tumor removals, can take place if hospitals have enough capacity and protective equipment to do so safely. Eye exams and elective procedures should be cancelled or rescheduled. If possible, health care visits should be done remotely. Dental services and preventive dental care may be resumed. Contact your doctor through <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/telehealth/">telehealth</a> to see what services they are providing.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I get my prescriptions filled?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. You may leave your home to obtain prescription medications or cannabis from dispensaries with medical permits.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You can contact your doctor through <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/telehealth/">telehealth</a> to get a new prescription or adjust your existing prescriptions.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How can I make sure the older Californians in my life are safe and healthy during the stay home order?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You should check in on your older neighbors and loved ones with a call, text or physically distanced door knock to make sure they are okay. You can also teach them how to FaceTime, Zoom, Google Duo or use Facebook video to communicate. The most important thing you can do is to keep in touch with older loved ones for their mental health and safety.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">I am an older Californian who is isolating at home and I need non-urgent assistance. What can I do?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You can call the statewide hotline for older Californians at <a href="tel:1-833-544-2374">833-544-2374</a> for your non-urgent medical needs, to get meals delivered, track down prescriptions and more. The most important thing you can do is stay home for your health and wellbeing. If you are experiencing an emergency please call 911.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I leave home to care for my elderly parents or friends who require assistance to care for themselves? Or a friend or family member who has disabilities?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Be sure that you protect them and yourself by following social distancing guidelines such as washing hands before and after, using hand sanitizer, maintaining at least six feet of distance when possible, and coughing or sneezing into your elbow or a tissue and then washing your hands. If you have early signs of a cold, please stay away from your older loved ones.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I visit loved ones in the hospital, nursing home, skilled nursing facility, or other residential care facility?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Generally no. There are limited exceptions, such as if you are going to the hospital with a minor who is under 18 or someone who is developmentally disabled and needs assistance. For most other situations, the order prohibits visitation to these kinds of facilities. This is difficult, but necessary to protect hospital staff and other patients. Check the <a href="https://www.aging.ca.gov/download.ashx?lE0rcNUV0zaaXLD5JZ%2f6Uw%3d%3d">frequently asked questions for friends and family with a loved one in a skilled nursing or residential care facility</a> for more detailed information.</p>
