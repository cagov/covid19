<h2 id="blueprint">Blueprint for a Safer Economy</h2>



<p>On August 28, 2020, the State released the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/">Blueprint for a Safer Economy</a> to permit gradual reopening of certain businesses and activities. Counties are assigned tiers that are updated weekly and determined by the county’s case rate and test positivity rate. Local jurisdictions may have more restrictive local orders than the assigned tier.</p>



<h2 id="hospital-surge">Hospital Surge Order</h2>



<p>Counties with 10% ICU availability or less, in regions with 0% ICU availability, are directed to prioritize services to those who are sickest and cancel or reschedule elective surgeries. This is per the <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Amendment-to-the-Order-of-the-State-Public-Health-Officer-Hospital-Surge-1-15-2020.aspx">Hospital Surge Public Health Order</a>, updated January 15, 2021.</p>



<h2 id="stay-home-order">Stay Home Order</h2>



<p>On March 19, 2020, an <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.19.20-attested-EO-N-33-20-COVID-19-HEALTH-ORDER.pdf">Executive Order (PDF)</a> and <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Health%20Order%203.19.2020.pdf">Public Health Order (PDF)</a> directed all Californians to stay home except to go to an essential job or to shop for essential needs. It was modified on <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.4.20-EO-N-60-20.pdf">May 4, 2020</a>.</p>

<h2>Past orders</h2>



<h3 id="regional-stay-home-order">Regional Stay Home Order</h3>



<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.3.20-Stay-at-Home-Order-ICU-Scenario.pdf">Regional Stay Home Order (PDF)</a>, announced December 3, 2020, triggers additional restrictions after a region has been announced to have less than 15% ICU availability. It prohibits private gatherings of any size, closes sector operations except for critical infrastructure and retail, and requires 100% masking (with certain exceptions as indicated in <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings.aspx">guidance for use of face coverings</a>) and physical distancing.<br><br>The Regional Stay Home Order was lifted January 25, 2021 as projected ICU availability over 4 weeks in all regions rose to over 15%. Once a region exits the Regional Stay Home Order, counties within that region return to the appropriate tier and rules under the Blueprint for a Safer Economy.</p>

<h3 id="limited-stay-home-order">Limited Stay Home Order</h3>



<p>The <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/limited-stay-at-home-order-qa.aspx">Limited Stay Home Order</a> (effective November 21, 2020) and its <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Supplement-to-Limited-Stay-At-Home-Order.aspx">Supplement</a> (effective December 22, 2020) required that in counties in the Widespread (purple) tier, Californians stay home between 10:00pm and 5:00am, with some exceptions. </p>



<p>This order was ended January 25, 2021 and is no longer in effect in any county in California.</p>



<h2 class="mt-5" id="faq">Questions and answers</h2>



<h3 class="h2 mt-4" id="rshoqas">Regional Stay Home Order</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Why is the Regional Stay Home Order ending?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">This order ended for all regions statewide on January 25, 2021 because 4-week ICU capacity projections in the three remaining regions under the order had reached 15% or higher. The Limited Stay at Home Order (curfew) has also ended. Counties will now return to restrictions according to their tier in the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/">Blueprint for a Safer Economy</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How do we know we won’t shut down again? What happens if ICUs are overwhelmed again?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">We are ending the Regional Stay Home Order and hope we do not need to resort to such strict measures to keep our health care system protected and to save lives. We will examine conditions moving forward as we always do and determine interventions as they are warranted moving forward. The State will continue to take public health measures necessary to protect vulnerable Californians and the health care delivery system. With everyone’s continued collaboration, we hope to continue on the path to reopening.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What does ending the Regional Stay Home Order mean for school reopening?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">This does not change the framework around school reopening. See <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Consolidated_Schools_Guidance.pdf">COVID-19 and Reopening In-Person Instruction Framework &amp; Public Health Guidance for K-12 Schools in California, 2020-2021 School Year</a>. Schools that are already open can remain open. Schools that are not already open must follow the reopening criteria laid out in that guidance.</p>



<h3 class="h2 mt-4">Hospital Surge Order</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How do I find out what the hospital/ICU capacity is in my region or county?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The state will post <a href="#icu-capacity">ICU capacity by region</a> daily. </p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The state also maintains a publicly-available dashboard on <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/state-dashboard/">hospital and ICU capacity by county</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will the state open up alternative care facilities or surge hospitals in the hardest-hit regions to reduce stress on hospitals?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Currently the state has 11 alternative care sites that could be activated in 24-96 hours should they be needed. The total number of beds in these alternative care sites is 1,862.&nbsp;In addition to the alternative care sites the state has 22 California Medical Stations, which are 50 bed field hospitals, in our cache that can be rapidly deployed. In total we have a capacity of approximately 3,000 additional medical beds currently available beyond what we have in the hospital system. Information on the number of alternative care sites and the number of surge beds in use can be found at the <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/COVID-19BedSurgeDashboard/BedSurge?:embed=y&amp;:showVizHome=no">Alternate Care Site Dashboard</a>.</p>



<h3 class="h2 mt-4" id="sho-qas">Stay Home Order</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">When does the Stay Home Order go into effect and how long will we stay home? What areas of the state are covered?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The order went into effect on Thursday, March 19, 2020. The order is in place until further notice. It covers the whole state of California.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The order was modified on <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.4.20-EO-N-60-20.pdf">May 4, 2020</a>. On <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/">August 28, 2020</a> the State released the Blueprint for a Safer Economy to permit gradual reopening of certain businesses and activities.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">As of November 21, 2020, Californians in counties in the Widespread (purple) tier are directed to <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/limited-stay-at-home-order.aspx">stop non-essential activities between 10PM and 5AM</a>.&nbsp;On December 21, 2020, this was <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Supplement-to-Limited-Stay-At-Home-Order.aspx">extended</a> to counties under the Regional Stay Home Order.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">See the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/">Blueprint for a Safer Economy</a> for state restrictions in your area. Further local restrictions may apply.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What is the relationship between the Stay Home Order and these questions and answers?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The Governor has ordered Californians to obey the directives of the State Public Health Officer. Those directives take many forms; they include specific materials linked on this page, as well as these questions and answers. These questions and answers are directives from the State Public Health Officer, and have the same force and effect as other State Public Health Officer directives.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can the Stay Home Order be changed?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. The State Public Health Officer may issue new orders as the public health situation changes.</p>



<h3 class="h2 mt-4" id="blueprint-qas">Blueprint for a Safer Economy</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What&#8217;s open in my county?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You can check the open or closed status of more than 90 kinds of businesses or activities at the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/">Blueprint for a Safer Economy</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Where can I see a map of California&#8217;s counties with their tier levels?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The Blueprint for a Safer Economy has a <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/#county-status">map of California</a> with each county&#8217;s current tier status: Widespread (purple), Substantial (red), Moderate (orange), or Minimal (yellow).</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I get a haircut?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It depends. In regions under a Regional Stay Home Order, hair salons and barbershops are closed. In other regions they&nbsp;are open, with modifications for safety. See <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/">what’s open in your area</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>Are playgrounds open?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Playgrounds may remain open to facilitate physically distanced personal health and wellness through outdoor exercise.&nbsp;Playgrounds located at schools that remain open for in-person instruction, and not accessible by the general public, may remain open and must follow&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Consolidated_Schools_Guidance.pdf" target="_blank">guidance for schools and school-based programs (PDF)</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Are swimming pools open?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Outdoor swimming pools are allowed to open in all counties in California. Outdoor pools must close slides, rides, or other attractions.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Indoor swimming pools are closed in counties in the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy">Widespread (purple) or Substantial (red) tiers</a>.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Drowning prevention classes, including swim lessons with certified instructors, are permitted in indoor and outdoor swimming pools in all tiers, as they are deemed essential.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Water parks, both indoor and outdoor, remain closed throughout the state.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">When out of the water, masks or face coverings should be worn. Physical distancing should be practiced at all times. Group gatherings are not allowed. Bring your own towel, and don&#8217;t share items that are worn on the face (like goggles, nose clips, or snorkels). Pool operators should follow heightened cleaning and safety guidance in response to COVID-19. See sector guidance for <a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-fitness--en.pdf">gyms and fitness centers</a> and <a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-campgrounds-outdoor-recreation--en.pdf">campgrounds and outdoor recreation</a>.</p>



<h3 class="h2 mt-4" id="general-qas">General</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Is it safe to shop at open businesses?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The risk of COVID-19 infection is still real for all Californians and continues to be fatal. That is why every business permitted to open should take every step humanly possible to reduce the risk of infection by following these <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#top">state guidelines</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What is considered an essential business?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Essential workforce and critical infrastructure sectors are defined on the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/essential-workforce/">Essential workforce</a> web page.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">If I am not an Essential Critical Infrastructure Worker, can I still leave the house?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. As described in more detail elsewhere in applicable state public health directives (including on this page), there are a wide range of circumstances in which you may leave your home or other place of residence, even if you are not an Essential Critical Infrastructure Worker. For example, you may leave your home to work at any business or other entity that is allowed to open, to engage in in-person worship and protest activities consistent with public health directives, to patronize local businesses, or to care for friends or family members who require assistance (as set forth under <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/#top">Health care</a>). And errands like these are not the only reasons you may leave your home: you may also leave your home with or without a specific destination in mind (for example, to walk your dog, to engage in physical recreation, or simply to get some fresh air) as long as you maintain physical distancing and comply with any other applicable public health directives.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Are safety protocols being enforced? How do I report a business that isn&#8217;t complying?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">They are being enforced, and you can report it. Report unsafe conditions or businesses that shouldn’t be open to your local Alcohol Beverage Control, Labor Commissioner’s office, or regional Cal/OSHA office, depending on the type of business. To find these local contacts, see Appendix B of the <a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/employer-playbook-for-safe-reopening--en.pdf">Employer Playbook for a Safe Reopening (PDF)</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-accordion-content"><!-- Adding keywords mask masks report reporting enforce enforcement compliance for quick answers purposes --></div>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I walk my dog? Take my pet to the vet?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You can walk your dog. You can go to the vet or pet hospital if your pet is sick. Remember to wear a face covering and distance yourself at least 6 feet from other pets and owners.</p>



<h3 class="h2 mt-4" id="political">Protected activities</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">I want to express my political views.&nbsp; How can I make my voice heard without raising public health concerns?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">There are many ways for you to express your political views without holding a physical, in-person gathering.&nbsp; For example, you may continue to call or write elected officials, write letters to the editor of news publications, display lawn or window signs, or use online and other electronic media (including Zoom rooms, Twitter feeds, Facebook pages, and other digital forums) to express your views.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Additionally, as noted above, you may leave your home for any reason as long as you comply with any other applicable public health directives. When you are otherwise out in public, public health directives do not prevent you from engaging in political expression—such as by wearing or carrying a sign.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If collective action in physical space is important to you, consider whether you and other participants can safely protest from within your cars.&nbsp;The State Public Health Officer does not consider in-car activities to be gatherings, if participants stay in their cars and otherwise remain apart from individuals who are not part of their households.&nbsp;Many activists have organized car-based protests (honking horns, flying flags, displaying signs, and so on) to express their political views while complying with State public health directives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Whenever you are considering a protest (including an in-car protest), make sure you comply with all other applicable laws, including any local public-health measures that may be more restrictive than statewide directives and any other applicable local laws.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you do wish to engage in in-person protest outside of your car with a group of any size, you must follow the guidelines for political protest gatherings below.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I engage in political rallies and protest gatherings?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, although in-person protests and rallies present special public health concerns&nbsp;for high risk of COVID-19 transmission.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Even with adherence to physical distancing, bringing members of different households together to engage in in-person protests and rallies carries an especially high risk of widespread transmission of COVID-19. &nbsp;Such gatherings may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities like chanting, shouting, singing, and group recitation negate the risk-reduction achieved through 6 feet of physical distancing. For this reason, people engaging in these activities must wear face coverings at all times. </p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Therefore, it is strongly recommended that those exercising their right to engage in political expression (including, for example, their right to petition the government) should utilize alternative channels, such as the many online and broadcasting platforms available in the digital age, in place of in-person gatherings.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">However, state public health directives do not prohibit in-person <em>outdoor</em> protests and rallies as long as you maintain a physical distance of at least 6 feet between persons or groups of persons from different households at all times. In addition, you must wear a face covering or mask. Local Health Officers are advised to consider appropriate limitations on outdoor attendance capacities, factoring their jurisdiction&#8217;s key COVID-19 health indicators. Failure to follow these requirements may result in an order to disperse or other enforcement action.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">In counties in the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/">Widespread (purple) tier</a>, indoor protests and rallies are not currently permitted. In other counties, state public health directives do not prohibit in-person&nbsp;<em>indoor</em> protests and rallies as long as&nbsp;(1) attendance is limited as required by the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy">relevant restrictions</a> on places of worship and local health restrictions, (2)&nbsp;physical distancing of at least 6 feet between persons or groups of persons from different households is maintained at all times, and (3) singing and chanting activities are discontinued.&nbsp;Failure to follow these requirements may result in an order to disperse or other enforcement action.&nbsp;Masks and face coverings are required in compliance with CDPH directives.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Participants must maintain a physical distance of at least 6 feet from any uniformed peace officers and other public safety personnel present, unless otherwise directed, and follow all other requirements and directives imposed by local health officers and law enforcement, or other applicable authorities.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">This limitation on attendance will be reviewed regularly. This review will assess the impacts of these imposed limits on public health and provide further direction as part of a phased-in restoration of gatherings that implicate the First Amendment.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion" id="vote">How do I vote?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong><a href="http://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/CDPH-to-SOS-Letter-from-Acting-HO-Aug-18-1.pdf">Elections are an essential activity</a>.</strong> The Governor has issued&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/05/08/governor-newsom-issues-executive-order-to-protect-public-health-by-mailing-every-registered-voter-a-ballot-ahead-of-the-november-general-election/">executive orders to ensure elections are safe and accessible</a>. Vote-by-mail ballots will be sent to all registered voters for the November 3, 2020 General Election. Most counties will provide&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/06/03/governor-newsom-signs-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-accessible-general-election-in-november/">three days of early voting</a>&nbsp;in-person starting the Saturday before the election. Open ballot drop-box locations will be available between October 6 and November 3, 2020. Existing laws addressing the use of vote-by-mail ballots in California elections remain in effect except where suspended by Executive Order.

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Practice physical distancing and follow other applicable public health directives while engaged in election-related activities. These include collection and drop-off of ballots, and collection of signatures to qualify candidates or measures for the ballot.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I go to church?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Places of worship such as churches, mosques, temples, and synagogues can open throughout the state, with <a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-places-of-worship--en.pdf">modifications for safety (PDF)</a>. In counties in the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy">Widespread (purple)</a> tier, indoor services in places of worship must be discontinued but outdoor and online services are permitted.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I practice my religious faith?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Practicing your faith is a constitutionally-protected activity and may manifest in many different forms.<!-- church, mosque, synagogue, temple, wedding, funeral, baptism --></p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Although in-person religious gatherings—like other in-person gatherings—have been restricted to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, on May 25, 2020, the State Public Health Officer began to ease restrictions on in-person religious gatherings. In particular, the State Public Health Officer now authorizes County Departments of Public Health to allow collective activities at places of worship, subject to conditions that support a safe, clean environment for employees, interns and trainees, volunteers, scholars, and all other types of workers as well as congregants, worshippers, and visitors.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What conditions must be met to resume religious services and cultural ceremonies at places of worship?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Information on conditions imposed by the state can be found at <a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-places-of-worship--en.pdf">guidance for places of worship (PDF)</a>. Additional conditions may be imposed by local public health officials. This guidance does not obligate places of worship to resume in-person activity. It is strongly recommended that places of worship continue to facilitate remote services and other alternatives to in-person religious practice for those who are vulnerable to COVID19.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Even with adherence to physical distancing, convening in a congregational setting of multiple households to practice a personal faith carries a higher risk of widespread transmission of COVID-19, and may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities like singing and group recitation dramatically increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission. For this reason, singing and chanting activities must be discontinued at indoor services, and congregants engaging in group recitation should wear face coverings at all times.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Places of worship may only open indoor operations when permitted by <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy">relevant local restrictions</a> and must comply with all applicable attendance limitations and guidance requirements.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Local Health Officers are advised to consider appropriate limitations on&nbsp;<em>outdoor&nbsp;</em>attendance capacities, factoring their jurisdiction&#8217;s key COVID-19 health indicators. At a minimum, outdoor attendance should be limited naturally through implementation of strict physical distancing measures of a minimum of 6 feet between attendees from different households, in addition to other relevant protocols within this document. </p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">This limitation will be regularly reviewed by the California Department of Public Health.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can children attend group activities (like Sunday school or Hebrew school) at places of worship?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes.&nbsp; Outdoor activities are permitted, and indoor activities are permitted if they comply with the <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/small-groups-child-youth.aspx">cohort guidance</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">When will current conditions change for places of worship?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The California Department of Public Health, in consultation with county Departments of Public Health, will regularly review and assess the impacts of these imposed limits on public health and provide further direction as part of a phased-in restoration of activities in places of worship. </p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Are weddings allowed?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, but only wedding ceremonies are allowed, not receptions. Wedding ceremonies should follow the guidance for <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#worship">Places of worship or cultural ceremonies</a>.

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Are gatherings for musical, theatrical, and artistic performances permitted?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Gatherings for live musical, theatrical, and other artistic performances are not permitted indoors or outdoors in counties under a Regional Stay Home Order,  or in counties that have been designated as having “Widespread” (purple) or “Substantial” risk levels of the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/">Blueprint for a Safer Economy</a>. Because such gatherings frequently involve the mixing of people from different communities creating a high risk of transmission of COVID-19, until&nbsp;further CDPH guidance is issued, such gatherings are&nbsp; allowed only in counties in the “Moderate” (orange) or “Minimal” (yellow) risk levels.&nbsp; In addition, performances are permitted only if, in the exercise of their discretion, the relevant local or city health officer approves the precautions taken to ensure the safety of audience members, performers and others connected with the performance.&nbsp; Performances may have no more than 50 persons in the audience in counties in the “Moderate” risk level and no more than 100 in counties in the “Minimal” risk level.&nbsp;If a local or city health officer approves a performance, the officer shall notify CDPH of the approval within two business days. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">During approved performances, all audience members and others not performing must wear masks, and audience members from different households must be spaced at least six feet apart when seated or otherwise viewing the performance. Performers who are not wearing face coverings must be at least six feet apart from each other.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Approval is not required in counties with a “Moderate” or “Minimal” risk level for a live musical, theatrical, or artistic performance if, in aggregate, members of no more than three households attend, perform, or otherwise are involved in the performance.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Additionally, live performances are permitted to the extent that they are permitted by applicable sector guidance for the venue hosting such a performance (such as restaurants, wineries, or bars).</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">It depends. Some smog check locations may be closed. The <a href="https://www.bar.ca.gov/COVID-19_Impacts_on_BAR_Programs_and_Services.aspx">Bureau of Automotive Repair</a> advises drivers to still pay DMV vehicle registration fees to avoid any late fees. However, you will not receive your new registration or year sticker until the smog information has been received by DMV. Once state and local orders or directives are no longer in effect, you can then obtain the required smog check certificate to complete the DMV vehicle registration process.</p>
