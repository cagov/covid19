<h3><strong>Questions and answers</strong></h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>What are the pay and benefits for California Health Corps professionals</strong>?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Salary rates for most of the health care professionals being hired for this emergency are listed in the <a href="https://www.calhr.ca.gov/Pay%20Scales%20Library/PS_Sec_05.pdf">CalHR Pay Scales</a> (pages 5.12 and 5.13). In addition, CalHR has established pay rates for medical roles that don&#8217;t have a corresponding regular classification and pay schedule, such as paramedics and EMTs. CalHR will determine specific salary and benefits after conducting a review of each application.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>Some healthcare professions are not listed. Are health professionals who are not listed (e.g., Medical Technicians, Lab Technicians, etc.) eligible for the California Health Corps?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">California Health Corps are currently only accepting applications for the healthcare professions listed on the website. However, we are constantly re-evaluating our needs during this fluid situation and will open the registration for other professionals, if the need arises.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong><strong>When can I expect to hear a response after completing my California Health Corps registration?</strong></strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Currently we anticipate the process may take up to two weeks, since an incredible number of responses are received and need to prioritize certain parts of the state, where the needs are the greatest. We will begin to contact the volunteers after verification of credentials, and based on current and anticipated needs.</p>
