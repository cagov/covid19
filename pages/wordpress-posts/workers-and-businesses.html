<h2>COVID-19 Prevention Emergency Temporary Standards</h2>



<p>Physical distancing and capacity limits for businesses and activities are over. Guidance for specific industries has ended. But employers are still responsible for maintaining safe environments for employees and customers. </p>



<p>Employers must follow workplace safety and health regulations to protect workers. That includes protecting workers from COVID-19. </p>



<p>Follow the California Division of Occupational Health and Safety (Cal/OSHA) COVID-19 Prevention <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/ETS.html">Emergency Temporary Standards</a> (ETS) to keep your workplace safe. They cover:</p>



<ul><li>How to prevent infection in the workplace</li><li>What to do about outbreaks</li><li>How to keep employees safe in employer-provided transportation and housing</li></ul>

<hr class="wp-block-separator" id="masking-at-work"/>



<h2>Masking at work</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings.aspx">Masks are strongly recommended</a> for everyone indoors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Workers must wear masks indoors in certain sectors. This includes healthcare, public transit, and correctional facilities.</p>



<p>Workers must wear masks during outbreaks and in employer-provided transportation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Employers must provide workers with masks upon request and at no cost to workers.</p>



<p>Find details about masking at work in the <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/COVID19FAQs.html#controls">face coverings section of the Cal/OSHA FAQs</a>.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" id="return-to-work-after-covid-19"/>



<h2>Returning to work after getting sick or exposed to COVID-19</h2>



<p>Employers must ensure workers meet the criteria in the COVID-19 Prevention <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/ETS.html">ETS</a> before they return to work.&nbsp;When CDPH recommends shorter periods, employers must ensure workers meet the CDPH-recommended criteria. Find details in the <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/COVID19FAQs.html#iso">isolation and quarantine section of the Cal/OSHA FAQs</a>.</p>



<h3>Workers exposed to someone with COVID-19 and have COVID-19 symptoms</h3>



<p>If you were exposed to someone with COVID-19 and you have <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">COVID-19 symptoms</a>, you can return to work when <strong>all</strong> of these are true:</p>



<ul><li>Your fever is gone, and<ul><li>You have no other symptoms, or</li><li>Your other symptoms are improving.</li></ul></li><li>You get a negative result from a COVID-19 test on Day 5 or later from when your symptoms began.</li><li>You wear a well-fitting mask around others for 10 days, especially when indoors.</li></ul>

<ul><li>At least 10 days have passed since your symptoms began</li><li>Your fever is gone for 24 hours&nbsp;</li><li>Your symptoms have improved</li></ul>



<p>This applies to everyone, regardless of vaccination status. It also applies to people who had a previous infection.</p>



<h3>Workers that do not have COVID-19 symptoms, but test positive</h3>



<p>If you do not have symptoms, but you test positive for COVID-19, you can return to work when <strong>all</strong> of these are true:</p>



<ul><li>You never developed symptoms.</li><li>You get a negative result from a COVID-19 test on Day 5 or later from your last exposure.</li><li>You wear a well-fitting mask around others for 10 days, especially when indoors.</li></ul>



<p>Otherwise, you cannot return to work for at least 10 days after you first tested positive. </p>



<p>This applies to everyone, regardless of vaccination status. It also applies to those who had a previous infection.</p>



<h3>Workers that do not have COVID-19 symptoms, but were exposed to someone with COVID-19</h3>



<p>If you were exposed to someone with COVID-19, but you do not have symptoms, you must get tested on Day 5. </p>



<p>You can continue to go to work if <strong>all </strong>of these are true:</p>



<ul><li>You&#8217;re fully vaccinated and either:<ul><li>Boosted, or</li><li>Not yet eligible for a booster.</li></ul></li><li>You continue not to have COVID-19 symptoms.</li><li>You get a negative result from a COVID-19 test on Day 5 from your last exposure.</li><li>You wear a well-fitting mask around others for 10 days, especially when indoors.</li></ul>



<p>If you cannot get tested on Day 5 because tests are not available, you can continue to go to work. You must do the following for 14 days after your last exposure:</p>



<ul><li>Wear a mask</li><li>Maintain 6 feet of distance from others</li></ul>



<p>If you&#8217;re eligible for a booster, but have not received it yet, you can continue to go to work if <strong>all</strong> of these are true:</p>



<ul><li>You get a negative result from a COVID-19 test within 3-5 days from your last exposure.</li><li>You continue to not have COVID-19 symptoms.&nbsp;</li><li>You wear a well-fitting mask around others for 10 days, especially when indoors.</li></ul>



<p>Otherwise, you can return to work when <strong>all</strong> of these are true:</p>



<ul><li>You never developed COVID-19 symptoms.&nbsp;</li><li>You get a negative result from a COVID-19 test on Day 5 or later from your last exposure.</li><li>You wear a well-fitting mask around others for 10 days, especially when indoors.</li></ul>



<p>If you do not get tested because tests are not available, you can return to work after Day 10 from your last exposure.</p>



<h3 id="exclusion-pay">Exclusion pay</h3>



<p>Employers must provide you with exclusion pay:</p>



<ul><li>When you’re excluded from the workplace due to exposure that occurred at work</li><li>For the days you would have worked during the exclusion period</li><li>That is the same as your regular rate of pay</li><li>To you no later than the regular payday for the pay period</li></ul>



<p>You&#8217;re not eligible for exclusion pay if you:</p>



<ul><li>Were assigned to work from home while excluded and were able to do so</li><li>Receive disability payments while excluded</li><li>Are covered by workers&#8217; compensation benefits and received temporary disability payments while excluded</li></ul>



<p>Employers <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/2019-Novel-Coronavirus.htm">cannot require you to use your standard accrued paid sick leave</a>. This is true even when you’ve been exposed to someone with COVID-19 at work and your employer must exclude you.</p>



<p>Read the <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/COVID19FAQs.html#exclusions">exclusion pay and benefits section of the Cal/OSHA FAQs</a> to learn more.</p>



<p>Consider <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dwc/FileAClaim.htm">filing a workers’ compensation claim</a> if you:</p>



<ul><li>Were exposed to COVID-19 in the workplace and test positive</li><li>Are unable to work due to COVID-19 symptoms.</li></ul>

<h3><strong>What to do if your employer does not follow workplace safety or other laws</strong></h3>



<p>Employers must exclude certain workers who were exposed to someone with COVID-19 from the workplace. If your employer fails to exclude exposed workers, <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/Complaint.htm">file a workplace safety complaint</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/HowToFileWageClaim.htm">File a wage claim</a> for exclusion pay if you:</p>



<ul><li>Were excluded from work due to a work-related exposure to COVID-19, and</li><li>Did not receive pay while excluded.</li></ul>



<p>You can also <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/HowToReportViolationtoBOFE.htm">file a report of a labor law violation</a> if this affects a group of workers.</p>



<p>You&#8217;re protected by <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/HowToFileLinkCodeSections.htm">California laws that prohibit retaliation</a> for exercising workplace rights. If your employer retaliates because you requested exclusion pay, <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Filing_your_complaint.htm">file a retaliation complaint</a>. <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/DistrictOffices.htm">Contact the California Labor Commissioner&#8217;s Office</a> for help.</p>
