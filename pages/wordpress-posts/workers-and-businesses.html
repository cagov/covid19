<h2>Temporary workplace standards for COVID-19</h2>



<p>Physical distancing and capacity limits for businesses and activities are over. Guidance for specific industries has ended. Yet, employers are still responsible for maintaining safe environments for employees and customers. </p>



<p>Employers must follow workplace safety and health regulations to protect workers. That includes protecting workers from COVID-19. </p>



<p>Follow the California Division of Occupational Health and Safety (Cal/OSHA) COVID-19 Prevention <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/ETS.html">Emergency Temporary Standards</a> (ETS) to keep your workplace safe. They cover:</p>



<ul><li>How to prevent infection in the workplace</li><li>What to do about outbreaks</li><li>How to keep employees safe in employer-provided transportation and housing</li></ul>

<hr class="wp-block-separator" id="masking-at-work"/>



<h2>Masking at work</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings.aspx">Masks are strongly recommended</a> for everyone indoors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Workers must wear masks indoors in certain sectors. This includes healthcare, correctional facilities, and long-term care settings.</p>



<p>Workers must wear masks during outbreaks. Workers must also wear masks when returning to work after having COVID-19 or a close contact.</p>



<p>Employers must provide workers with masks upon request and at no cost to workers.</p>



<p>Find details about masking at work in the <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/COVID19FAQs.html#controls">face coverings section of the Cal/OSHA FAQs</a>.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" id="return-to-work-after-covid-19"/>



<h2>Returning to work after COVID-19</h2>



<p>Employers must ensure workers meet the criteria in the COVID-19 Prevention <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/ETS.html">ETS</a> before they return to work and that workers follow the CDPH-recommended isolation periods. Find details in the <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/COVID19FAQs.html#iso">isolation and quarantine section of the Cal/OSHA FAQs</a>. The following guidelines<em> do not</em> apply to workers in certain <em>high-risk settings</em> such as healthcare.</p>



<h3>Workers exposed to someone with COVID-19 and have symptoms</h3>



<p>If you were exposed to someone with COVID-19 and you have <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">COVID-19 symptoms</a>, you can return to work when <strong>all</strong> of these are true:</p>



<ul><li>You get a <strong>negative</strong> result from a COVID-19 test at least 5 days after the start of symptoms or first positive test result.</li><li>You wear a well-fitting mask around others for 10 days, especially when indoors.</li></ul>



<p>Otherwise, you cannot return to work until <strong>all</strong> of these are true:</p>



<ul><li>At least 10 days have passed since your symptoms began.</li></ul>



<p>This applies to everyone, regardless of vaccination status. It also applies to people who had a previous infection.</p>



<h3>Workers exposed to someone with COVID-19, and do not have symptoms</h3>



<p>If you were exposed to someone with COVID-19, but you do not have symptoms, you must get tested on Day 3 to Day 5.</p>



<p>You can continue to go to work if <strong>all</strong> of these are true:</p>



<ul><li>You continue not to have COVID-19 symptoms.</li><li>You get a negative result from a COVID-19 test on Day 3 to Day 5 from your last exposure.</li><li>You wear a well-fitting mask around others for 10 days, especially when indoors.</li></ul>



<p>If you do not get tested on Day 3 to Day 5 due to lack of tests, you must be excluded from work for 10 days after your last exposure. </p>



<p>This applies to everyone, regardless of vaccination status. Persons infected within the prior 90 days do not need to be tested unless symptoms develop.</p>



<h3>Workers that test positive for COVID-19, but do not have symptoms</h3>



<p>If you do not have symptoms, but you test positive for COVID-19, you can return to work when <strong>all</strong> of these are true: </p>



<ul><li>You never developed symptoms.</li><li>You get a negative result from a COVID-19 test on Day 5 or later from your last exposure or date of positive test.</li><li>You wear a well-fitting mask around others for 10 days, especially when indoors.</li></ul>



<p>Otherwise, you cannot return to work for at least 10 days after you first tested positive. This applies to everyone, regardless of vaccination status. It also applies to those who have had a previous infection.</p>



<h3 id="exclusion-pay">Exclusion pay</h3>



<p>Employers must provide you with exclusion pay:</p>



<ul><li>When you’re excluded from the workplace due to exposure that occurred at work.</li><li>For the days you would have worked during the exclusion period.</li><li>That is the same as your regular rate of pay.</li><li>To you no later than the regular payday for the pay period.</li></ul>



<p>You&#8217;re not eligible for exclusion pay if you:</p>



<ul><li>Were assigned to work from home while excluded and were able to do so.</li><li>Receive disability payments while excluded.</li><li>Are covered by workers&#8217; compensation benefits and received temporary disability payments while excluded.</li></ul>



<p>Employers <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/2019-Novel-Coronavirus.htm">cannot require you to use your standard accrued paid sick leave</a>. This is true even when you’ve been exposed to someone with COVID-19 at work and your employer must exclude you.</p>



<p>Read the <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/COVID19FAQs.html#exclusions">exclusion pay and benefits section of the Cal/OSHA FAQs</a> to learn more.</p>



<p>Consider <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dwc/FileAClaim.htm">filing a workers’ compensation claim</a> if you:</p>



<ul><li>Were exposed to COVID-19 in the workplace and test positive</li><li>Are unable to work due to COVID-19 symptoms</li></ul>

<h3><strong>If your employer does not follow workplace safety</strong></h3>



<p>Employers must exclude certain workers who were exposed to someone with COVID-19 from the workplace. If your employer fails to exclude exposed workers, <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/Complaint.htm">file a workplace safety complaint</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/HowToFileWageClaim.htm">File a wage claim</a> for exclusion pay if you:</p>



<ul><li>Were excluded from work due to a work-related exposure to COVID-19, and</li><li>Did not receive pay while excluded.</li></ul>



<p>You can also <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/HowToReportViolationtoBOFE.htm">file a report of a labor law violation</a> if this affects a group of workers.</p>



<p>You&#8217;re protected by <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/HowToFileLinkCodeSections.htm">California laws that prohibit retaliation</a> for exercising workplace rights. If your employer retaliates because you requested exclusion pay, <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Filing_your_complaint.htm">file a retaliation complaint</a>. <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/DistrictOffices.htm">Contact the California Labor Commissioner&#8217;s Office</a> for help.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" id="vaccination-testing-requirements"/>



<h2>Employers may require workers to be vaccinated</h2>
