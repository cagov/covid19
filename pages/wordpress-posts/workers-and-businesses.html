<p class="emphasized">California has rules to keep workplaces safe from COVID-19. Learn how you can keep yourself protected.</p>



<h2>Workplace Safety and Health Rules</h2>



<p>Employers must follow workplace safety and health regulations to protect workers. That includes protecting workers from COVID-19.</p>



<p>Follow the California Division of Occupational Health and Safety (Cal/OSHA) <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/Non_Emergency_Regulations/">COVID-19 Prevention Prevention Non-Emergency Regulations</a> and <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/DOSH/Coronavirus/Covid-19-NE-Reg-FAQs.html">Frequently Asked Questions</a> to keep your workplace safe. They cover:</p>



<ul><li>Masking and other personal protective equipment</li><li>How to prevent infection in the workplace</li><li>What to do about outbreaks</li><li>How to keep employees safe in employer-provided transportation and housing</li><li>Benefits available for excluded workers</li></ul>



<p>Workers who are at much higher risk of being exposed to someone with an infectious disease spread in the air are protected by the Cal/OSHA Aerosol Transmissible Disease (ATD) Standard. </p>



<p>Examples include workers in healthcare and correctional facilities. Visit the <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/dosh_publications/Aerosol-Diseases-fs.pdf">ATD Safety &amp; Health Fact Sheet</a> to learn more.</p>

<h2>Employee Protections</h2>



<p>You’re protected by <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/HowToFileLinkCodeSections.htm">California laws that prohibit retaliation</a> for exercising workplace rights. If your employer retaliates because you requested exclusion pay, <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Filing_your_complaint.htm">file a retaliation complaint</a>. <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/DistrictOffices.htm">Contact the California Labor Commissioner’s Office</a> for help.</p>



<p>If long COVID affects your ability to work, you may be able to ask your employer for accommodations to help you do your job. Visit the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/odep/topics/coronavirus-covid-19-long-covid">US Department of Labor website</a> for more information.  </p>



<p>Learn more about resources on the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/long-covid/">Post-COVID conditions (Long COVID) &#8211; Coronavirus COVID-19 Response (ca.gov)</a> page and the CDPH <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Post-COVID-QA.aspx">Post-COVID Conditions (Long COVID) Questions &amp; Answers (ca.gov)</a>.</p>
