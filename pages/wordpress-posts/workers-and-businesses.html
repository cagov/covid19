<p class="emphasized">California has rules to keep workplaces safe from COVID-19.</p>



<h2>Workplace Safety and Health Rules</h2>



<p>Employers must follow workplace safety and health regulations to protect workers. That includes protecting workers from COVID-19.</p>



<p>Follow the California Division of Occupational Health and Safety (Cal/OSHA) <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/Non_Emergency_Regulations/">COVID-19 Prevention Prevention Non-Emergency Regulations</a> and <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/DOSH/Coronavirus/Covid-19-NE-Reg-FAQs.html">Frequently Asked Questions</a> to keep your workplace safe. They cover:</p>



<ul><li>Masking and other personal protective equipment</li><li>How to prevent infection in the workplace</li><li>What to do about outbreaks</li><li>How to keep employees safe in employer-provided transportation and housing</li><li>Benefits available for excluded workers</li></ul>



<p>Workers who are at much higher risk of being exposed to someone with an infectious disease spread in the air are protected by the Cal/OSHA Aerosol Transmissible Disease (ATD) Standard. Examples include workers in healthcare and correctional facilities. Visit the <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/dosh_publications/Aerosol-Diseases-fs.pdf">ATD Safety &amp; Health Fact Sheet</a> to learn more.</p>
