<h3 class="js-qa-question">Help for self-employed and independent contractors</h3>



<p class="js-qa-answer">On April 28, the state rolled out a new program to help unemployed or partially unemployed Californians who are business owners, self-employed, independent contractors, and others who are financially impacted by the pandemic. This is a federally funded program called the <a href="https://edd.ca.gov/About_EDD/coronavirus-2019/pandemic-unemployment-assistance.htm">Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program</a>. PUA benefits are available if you don’t qualify for regular UI benefits in California or another state, and also don’t qualify for State Disability Insurance or Paid Family Leave benefits. PUA benefits <a href="https://www.labor.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Labor-Secretary-Letter-04.14.20.pdf">will be issued within 24-48 hours</a>, not the traditional 21 days ​for regular UI claims.</p>



<h3>More benefits for workers receiving UI or PUA</h3>



<p class="js-qa-answer">California workers who receive Unemployment Insurance (UI) or Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) benefits between March 29 and July 25, 2020 will get <a href="https://www.edd.ca.gov/about_edd/coronavirus-2019/cares-act.htm#PAC">$600 per week added</a> automatically to their benefits through the federal CARES Act.</p>



<p class="js-qa-answer">If you’ve used all of your available Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits, an additional 13 weeks of benefits may be available through the federally funded <a href="https://www.edd.ca.gov/about_edd/coronavirus-2019/cares-act.htm#PEUC">Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC)</a>.&nbsp;If you’ve used all your PEUC benefits, an additional 20 weeks of benefits may be available through the <a href="https://www.edd.ca.gov/about_edd/coronavirus-2019/fed-ed.htm">Federal-State Extended Duration (FED-ED)</a> benefits program.</p>



<p>Workers who received unemployment benefits between July 26 and August 15, 2020 may get <a href="https://www.edd.ca.gov/about_edd/coronavirus-2019/lost-wages-assistance.htm">$300 per week added</a> to their benefits through the Lost Wages Assistance (LWA) program. This includes regular Unemployment Insurance, Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation, or FED-ED extensions. The payments are for weeks of unemployment beginning July 26, 2020, and will be available for a limited period of time.</p>
