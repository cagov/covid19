<h3 class="js-qa-question">Help for self-employed and independent contractors</h3>



<p class="js-qa-answer">On April 28, the state rolled out a new program to help unemployed or partially unemployed Californians who are business owners, self-employed, independent contractors, and others who are financially impacted by the pandemic. This is a federally funded program called the <a href="https://edd.ca.gov/About_EDD/coronavirus-2019/pandemic-unemployment-assistance.htm">Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program</a>. </p>



<p>PUA benefits are available if you do not qualify for regular UI benefits in California or another state, and also do not qualify for State Disability Insurance or Paid Family Leave benefits. The PUA program includes up to 57 weeks of benefits.</p>



<h3>More benefits for workers receiving UI or PUA</h3>



<p class="js-qa-answer">Beginning December 27, California workers who receive UI or Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) benefits will get $300 per week added automatically to their benefits.</p>



<p>Workers who received benefits between July 26 and September 5, 2020 will get <a href="https://www.edd.ca.gov/about_edd/coronavirus-2019/lost-wages-assistance.htm">$300 per week added</a> automatically to their benefits.</p>



<p>Workers who received benefits between March 29 and July 25, 2020 will get <a href="https://www.edd.ca.gov/about_edd/coronavirus-2019/cares-act.htm#PAC">$600 per week added</a> automatically to their benefits.</p>



<p class="js-qa-answer">If you’ve used all of your available UI benefits, an additional 24 weeks of benefits may be available through the <a href="https://www.edd.ca.gov/about_edd/coronavirus-2019/cares-act.htm#PEUC">Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC)</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="js-qa-answer">If you’ve used all your PEUC benefits, an additional 20 weeks of benefits may be available through the <a href="https://www.edd.ca.gov/about_edd/coronavirus-2019/fed-ed.htm">Federal-State Extended Duration (FED-ED)</a> benefits program.</p>
