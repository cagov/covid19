<h2>Test it</h2>



<p>If you have COVID-19 symptoms, take a COVID-19 test as soon as possible. Act quickly because COVID-19 medications must be taken within 5-7 days of when symptoms begin. This does not have to be a lab test. At-home test results are okay. For more information on how to get tested, <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/get-tested/">click here</a>. </p>



<p>If you test positive for COVID-19, seek treatment right away. Do not wait for symptoms to get worse. Stay home and isolate to prevent spreading the disease to others. Even if you are vaccinated or have had COVID-19 before, you should isolate for at least 5 full days. <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/quarantine-and-isolation/">Learn about isolation guidelines</a>.</p>



<p>If your test is negative but you continue to have symptoms, test again 24-48 hours later. Low amounts of virus early in infection can be missed, and you can test positive a few days later.</p>

<p>COVID-19 medications have been shown to stop COVID-19 illness from getting serious. They can lower the risk of serious illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19 by half or more. They may help you test negative sooner. Early evidence also suggests COVID-19 treatment may decrease the risk of developing <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/long-covid/">long COVID symptoms</a>. Long COVID symptoms can last for weeks, months, or years after a COVID-19 infection.</p>
