<h2>When to get treatment</h2>



<p>COVID-19 medications must be taken within the first 5-7 days of symptoms. </p>



<p><strong>If you have COVID-19 symptoms</strong>, take a COVID-19 test as soon as possible. At-home test results are okay. <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/get-tested/">Click here</a> for more information on how to get tested. </p>



<p><strong>If you test positive for COVID-19</strong>, seek treatment right away. Do not wait for symptoms to get worse. Stay home and isolate to prevent spreading the disease to others. Even if you are vaccinated or have had COVID-19 before, you should isolate for at least 5 full days. <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/quarantine-and-isolation/">Learn about isolation guidelines</a>.</p>



<p><strong>If your test is negative</strong> but you continue to have symptoms, test again 24-48 hours later. Low amounts of virus early in infection can be missed, and you can test positive a few days later.</p>



<p>If you have severe COVID-19 symptoms including trouble breathing, chest pain, confusion, or trouble staying awake, go to the emergency room or call 911 right away.</p>
