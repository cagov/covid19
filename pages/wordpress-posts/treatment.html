<h2>When to get treatment</h2>



<p>If you have COVID-19 symptoms, seek treatment right away. <strong>Treatment works best if started right after symptoms start. Treatment must be taken within 5-7 days of the start of symptoms.</strong> <strong>Do not wait for symptoms to get worse.</strong></p>



<p>If you have severe <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">COVID-19 symptoms</a> including trouble breathing, chest pain, confusion, or trouble staying awake, <strong>go to the emergency room or call 911 right away</strong>.</p>



<p>Isolate (stay home and avoid others) until the threat of infecting other people has passed. Read about <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/quarantine-and-isolation/">how long to isolate</a>.</p>



<p>Notify people you have been in contact with so they can get tested too. <a href="https://cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/CANotify/code.aspx">Send an exposure notification</a> through CA Notify.</p>



<h3>If you have COVID-19 symptoms, but haven&#8217;t tested positive yet</h3>



<p>Vaccinated or not, get tested immediately if you’re feeling any <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">COVID-19 symptoms</a>. You must have a positive COVID-19 test result to get treatment. You also don’t want to accidentally expose others to COVID-19 because you didn’t know you had the virus.</p>



<p>You have many options for getting a COVID-19 test:</p>



<ul><li>Use an at-home test. Kits are available at most pharmacies without a prescription.&nbsp;</li><li>Locate a testing site near you. Some testing sites can also help you get COVID-19 treatments. <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/get-tested/">Learn how to get tested</a>.</li></ul>



<p>If your test is negative but you continue to have symptoms, test again 24-48 hours later. Low amounts of virus early in infection can be missed, and the test can be positive a few days later.</p>
