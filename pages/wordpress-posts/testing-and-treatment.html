<h2>Types of tests</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/coronavirus-testing-basics">Two types of COVID-19 tests</a> are available: <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Guidance-for-Health-Care-Providers.aspx">Diagnostic tests</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html">antibody tests</a> (or serology tests). See this <a href="https://youtu.be/5hu7_xIsCRg">FDA video</a> for a quick introduction.</p>



<p>A <strong>diagnostic test</strong> can show if you have an active coronavirus infection.&nbsp;Currently there are two types of diagnostic tests:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html"><strong>viral PCR</strong> <strong>tests </strong>(or molecular tests)</a> that detect the virus’s genetic material, and <a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/coronavirus-testing-basics"><strong>antigen</strong> <strong>tests</strong></a> that detect specific proteins on the surface of the virus.</p>



<p>California’s community-based<a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/Nearby/index.html?appid=43118dc0d5d348d8ab20a81967a15401"> testing sites</a> use viral PCR tests. Verily’s Project Baseline and OptumServe provide these tests.</p>



<p>Antigen tests usually provide results faster than viral PCR tests, but have a higher chance of missing an active infection. Currently, antigen tests are not widely used.</p>



<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">What is an antibody test? Where can I get an antibody test?</div>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html"><strong>Antibody tests</strong></a> detect past infections. They can determine if you are a good candidate to <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/plasma/">donate blood plasma</a>. It can take 1-3 weeks after infection for your body to make antibodies.</p>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">You can find locations for both viral and antibody tests on <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/Nearby/index.html?appid=43118dc0d5d348d8ab20a81967a15401">California’s testing map</a>.</p>



<h2>Cost for testing&nbsp;</h2>



<p>There are no out-of-pocket costs for <a href="https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/Portals/0/Docs/DO/DMHC-FAQForHealthCoverageOfCOVID-19Testing.pdf">medically-necessary</a> testing. If you have medical insurance, Verily or OptumServe will bill your insurance company. If you’re uninsured, <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/CovidUninsuredClaim">the government pays for your test</a>.</p>



<h2>Who can get tested</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Updated-COVID-19-Testing-Guidance.aspx">CDPH has prioritized testing</a>, based on risk, as follows:</p>



<p><strong>Tier one&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 symptoms</li><li>Those identified through an outbreak or contact tracing&nbsp; investigation</li></ul>



<p><strong>Tier two&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>All other individuals with COVID-19 symptoms</li><li>Close contacts of confirmed cases&nbsp;</li><li>People without symptoms, but who are:<ul><li>Residents in group living facilities</li><li>Healthcare workers who care for COVID-19 patients</li><li>Workers in group living facilities and in-home support services</li><li>Workers in the emergency service sector who have frequent interactions with the public or people with COVID-19. This includes first responders and other public service departments.</li><li>Workers in correctional facilities</li><li>Hospital admission and discharge patients</li></ul></li></ul>



<p><strong>Tier three</strong></p>



<ul><li>People without symptoms, but who are:<ul><li><a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/essential-workforce/">Essential workers</a></li><li>Education workers who have frequent interactions with students or the public</li></ul></li></ul>



<p><strong>Tier four&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>People without symptoms, but who are:<ul><li>At risk of infection&nbsp;</li><li>Being tested by their employer</li></ul></li></ul>



<h2>How you can get tested</h2>



<p>California has partnered with Verily and OptumServe to provide free, confidential testing statewide. The state’s testing program ensures that every county has enough testing capacity. Tests are available for underserved communities and individuals who are at high risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other testing sites may be available to you. Contact your healthcare provider, <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Pages/LocalHealthServicesAndOffices.aspx">county public health department,</a> or <a href="https://www.californiahealthplus.org/CHPlus/Find_My_Health_Plus_Center/CHPlus/FIND_MY_HEALTH__CENTER/Clinic-Finder.aspx?hkey=9cd9f887-b092-4439-a9bc-7032454c9273">local clinic</a> to find out your options for diagnosis and testing.</p>

<h4><strong><strong>Testing questions and answers</strong></strong></h4>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How do I get a drive-through test by Verily’s Project Baseline?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">There are two steps to this process: screening and testing. First, you will create an account and take the online screener. If you are eligible, you will get details on how and where to get tested. Once tested, you’ll get an email or phone call with your COVID-19 test results.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Why am I asked to create an account for Verily?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Verily needs a way to authenticate and protect user information. They turned to Google for this service, because Google accounts have best-in-class authentication. Simply link to an existing Google account or create a new one (which you can do with any email address). Then Verily can contact you securely during the screening and testing process. All data r collected by Verily is kept private and is not linked to a user’s Google account.</p>



<h2>OptumServe testing sites</h2>



<p>Tests are by appointment only. Find a location near you and make an appointment at:</p>

<p>OptumServe community testing sites serve all individuals who qualify for a test. This includes uninsured, underinsured, undocumented and homeless individuals. You do not need a driver’s license to get this test.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Treatment questions and answers</h2>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Do I need emergency treatment?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you develop any of these symptoms of COVID-19, get medical attention immediately:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Trouble breathing</li><li>Persistent pain or pressure in the chest</li><li>New confusion&nbsp;</li><li>Inability to awake or stay awake</li><li>Bluish lips or face</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">There are other, less-common symptoms. Please call your medical provider if you have any symptoms that are severe or concern you.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you need to go to the hospital, call ahead so they can prepare for your arrival. If you call <a href="tel:911">911</a>, tell the operator you have coronavirus symptoms. This is so ambulance workers can be ready to treat you safely.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Not sure if this applies to you? Check your symptoms with the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsymptoms-testing%2Findex.html">Symptom Screener</a> or contact your doctor through <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/telehealth/">telehealth</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">When can I be around other people after I had or likely had COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You can be with others after:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>10 days since symptoms first appeared <strong>and</strong></li><li>At least 24 hours with no fever without fever-reducing medication <strong>and</strong></li><li>After symptoms have improved</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">CDC has <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/end-home-isolation.html">detailed recommendations</a> for people who had tested positive but had no symptoms.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">When can I be around other people after I tested positive for COVID-19 but had no symptoms?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you continue to have no symptoms, you can be with others after 10 days have passed since your test.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">CDC has <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/end-home-isolation.html">detailed recommendations</a> for people who had tested positive for coronavirus but had no symptoms.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Should employees be required to provide proof of a negative coronavirus test before returning to work after they had COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. Proof of a negative test should not be required prior to returning to the workplace after documented COVID infection, since PCR tests can remain positive long after an individual is no longer infectious.&nbsp;CDPH <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Updated-COVID-19-Testing-Guidance.aspx">COVID-19 Testing Guidance</a> recommends symptom- or protocol-based criteria be used to determine when an employee is safe to return to the workplace.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can two people that both tested positive hang out/stay together?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. You should take preventive measures to protect yourself and others. We do not know yet if or when a person can be reinfected with COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">If I test positive for COVID-19 in a viral test, what should I do to protect others in my household?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You should <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/isolation.html">self-isolate</a> from others in your household who have not tested positive. Sleep and stay in a separate room from them, and use a separate bathroom, if possible. Multiple infected people in the same household can use the same room for isolation.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Members of your household should get tested right away. They should <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html">quarantine</a> for at least 14 days. Symptoms can develop even after testing negative within 14 days after exposure. Multiple people in the same household should not quarantine in the same room, since some may be infected.</p>



<h3>California’s COVID-19 Testing Task Force</h3>
