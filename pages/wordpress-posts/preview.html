<p>If a county decides to pursue a variance to move further into Stage 2, the local public health officer must:</p>



<ol><li>Notify the California Department of Public Health (CDPH).</li><li>Certify through submission of a written attestation to CDPH that the county has met the readiness criteria (outlined below), including guidance to be issued by the county and detailed plans, and that the county is designed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.</li></ol>



<p><strong>A list of counties that have met the criteria is available <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Local-Variance-Attestations.aspx">here</a>.</strong></p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong>Contact Tracing</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Sufficient contact tracing so public health staff work can work with a patient to help them recall everyone with whom they have had close contact during the timeframe while they may have been infectious.&nbsp; For counties that have no cases, there should be at least 15 staff per 100,000 county population trained and available for contact tracing; for counties with small populations, there must be at least one staff person trained and available.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong>Hospital Surge</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>County (or regional) hospital capacity to accommodate a minimum surge of 35% due to COVID-19 cases in addition to providing usual care for non-COVID-19 patients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>

The county&#8217;s plans to support individuals, including those experiencing homelessness, who are not able to properly isolate in a home setting by providing them with temporary housing (including access to a private bathroom), for the duration of the necessary isolation or quarantine period must be described.</li></ul></li></ul>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>County (or regional) hospital facilities have a robust plan to protect the hospital workforce, both clinical and nonclinical, with PPE.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Guidance for employers and essential critical infrastructure workplaces on how to structure the physical environment to protect essential workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Availability of supplies (disinfectant, essential protective gear) to protect essential workers.&nbsp;</li><li>Each county must provide details on their plans to move further into Stage 2 including which sectors and spaces will be opened, in what sequence, on what timeline.&nbsp; Please specifically indicate where the plan differs from the state&#8217;s order.&nbsp; Please note that this variance should not include sectors that are part of Stage 3.</li><li>County metrics that would serve as triggers for either slowing the pace through Stage 2 or tightening modifications, including the frequency of measurement, the specific actions triggered by metric changes must be described, and how the county will inform the state of emerging concerns and how it will implement early containment measures.&nbsp;</li><li>The county must provide details on the plan to move through opening sectors and spaces that are part of the State&#8217;s plan for Stage 2. A reminder, that this variance only covers those areas that are part of Stage 2, up to, but not including Stage 3.&nbsp;</li></ul>

  </a>
</div>



<p>Californians have been staying home and saving lives since the start of our statewide stay-at-home order issued on March 19, 2020. These efforts have allowed the state to move forward on our <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Update-on-California-Pandemic-Roadmap.pdf">roadmap</a> for modifying the statewide order.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are now in early <strong>Stage 2</strong>, where retail (curbside and delivery only), related logistics and manufacturing,&nbsp;office workplaces, limited personal services, outdoor museums, child care, and <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/essential-workforce/">essential businesses</a> can open with modifications. The state is <a href="http://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance">issuing guidance</a> to help these workplaces reopen safely.</p>



<h2>County variance</h2>



<p>Stage 2 expansion will be phased in gradually. Some communities may move through Stage 2 faster if they are able to show greater progress. Counties that have met the readiness criteria and worked with the California Department of Public Health can open more workplaces as outlined on the <a href="http://covid19.ca.gov/roadmap-counties">County Variance page</a>.</p>



<h2>Industry guidance to reduce the risk</h2>



<p>California moved into Stage 2 of modifying the state’s Stay-at-Home order on May 8, 2020. Our progress in achieving key <a href="http://cert1.mail-west.com/ygO/7rmtB/tBgtmyuzjanmc/8t71/8l9ety77/5hq/2tBncv">public health metrics</a> will allow a gradual re-opening of California’s economy.</p>



<p>We recognize the impact of economic hardship. We must get our economy roaring once again and put paychecks in people’s pockets. But the risk of COVID-19 infection is still real for all Californians and continues to be fatal.</p>



<p>The state is <a href="http://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance">issuing guidance</a> for businesses to follow, if they’re permitted to open per County Public Health rules.</p>



<a class="action-link mr-30" hreflang="en" href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/">Find the Industry Guidance</a>



<h2>Customers and individuals</h2>



<p>Customers and individuals are encouraged to stay home if they have a fever or other COVID-19 symptoms. Those with symptoms or elevated temperatures should not shop, get services in person, go to work, or gather with others. If you’re not sure if this applies to you, check your symptoms with this <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsymptoms-testing%2Findex.html">Symptom Screener</a>.</p>



<p>Higher risk individuals (over 65 or with serious medical conditions) should continue to stay home until Stage 4. Minimize errands by getting groceries delivered or asking for help from friends or family.</p>



<p><strong>Shop safely! </strong>Crowded settings increase your risk of exposure to COVID-19. Wear a face covering or cloth mask, stay 6 feet away from others, avoid touching your face, and wash your hands when you get home.</p>
