<p>Local health jurisdictions that meet the criteria set forth by the California Department of Public Health and follow the process in the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/County_Variance_Attestation_Form.aspx" target="_blank">county guidance</a>&nbsp;may move&nbsp;further<strong>&nbsp;</strong>ahead in the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://covid19.ca.gov/roadmap/" target="_blank">Resilience Roadmap</a>.</p>



<p>If a county decides to pursue a variance to move further ahead in the Resilience Roadmap, the local public health officer must:</p>



<ol><li>Notify the California Department of Public Health (CDPH).</li><li>Certify through submission of a written attestation to CDPH that the county has met the readiness criteria (outlined below), including guidance to be issued by the county and detailed plans, and that the county is designed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.</li></ol>



<p>See the <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/County_Variance_Attestation_Form.aspx">list of counties</a> that have met the criteria.</p>

<h2><strong>County data monitoring</strong></h2>



<p>California is monitoring COVID-19 closely in each local community and keeping the public informed. We’re teaming up with counties to fight it with every tool we have: current local data, testing, contact tracing, infection control, emergency supplies, containment measures, and more.</p>



<p>Counties should be ready to restore limitations if outbreaks increase. The State Public Health Officer may take action if needed.</p>



<p>The three steps below outline the county data monitoring process. </p>
