<h2 id="extended-deadline">Extended filing deadline</h2>



<p>The due date to file and pay taxes and fees owed to the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) originally due between December 15, 2020, and April 30, 2021 has been extended by three months. This extension is generally granted to individuals and businesses with less than $1 million in taxes and fees.</p>



<p>To request an extension if you have more than $1 million in taxes and fees or to ask a question about the extension, call CDTFA <a href="tel:800-400-7115" data-type="tel" data-id="tel:800-400-7115">800-400-7115</a>.</p>



<p>This extension does not apply to California individual tax returns sent to the Franchise Tax Board.</p>

<h2 id="individual-taxes">Help for individuals</h2>



<p>You can now claim the California Earned Income Tax Credit and Young Child Tax Credit without an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN). These tax credits can be claimed on 2020 individual tax returns (which are filed in 2021).</p>



<p>You can also use your 2019 income to claim the federal Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit on your 2020 taxes. This lets you claim these credits even if your income was lower in 2020 due to job loss or underemployment.</p>
