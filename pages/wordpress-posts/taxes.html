<h2 id="extended-deadline">Extended filing deadline</h2>



<p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Franchise Tax Board (FTB) have extended the due date for individual income taxes to May 17, 2021. This extension does not apply to estimated taxes due to the IRS or FTB on April 15, 2021.</p>



<p>The due date to file and pay taxes and fees owed to the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) originally due between December 15, 2020, and April 30, 2021 has been extended by three months. This extension is generally granted to businesses with less than $1 million in taxes and fees.</p>



<p>To request an extension if you have more than $1 million in taxes and fees due or to ask a question about the extension, call CDTFA <a href="tel:800-400-7115" data-type="tel" data-id="tel:800-400-7115">800-400-7115</a>.</p>

<h2 id="individual-taxes">Help for individuals</h2>



<h3>Golden State Stimulus</h3>



<p>The Golden State Stimulus (GSS) is a $600, one-time relief payment. You’ll get it if you receive the California Earned Income Tax Credit after claiming it on your 2020 individual tax return, which is filed this year.</p>



<p>You’ll get an additional $600, one-time GSS payment if you file your return with an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN).</p>



<p>ITIN filers who do not receive the California Earned Income Tax Credit but earn $75,000 or less will get a $600 GSS payment.</p>



<p>You’ll receive your GSS payments shortly after you file your 2020 taxes.</p>



<h3>Expanded Earned Income Tax Credit qualifications</h3>



<p>You can now claim the California Earned Income Tax Credit and the state&#8217;s Young Child Tax Credit with an ITIN. These tax credits can be claimed on 2020 individual tax returns.</p>



<p>You can also use your 2019 income to claim two federal tax credits, the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit, on your 2020 taxes. This lets you claim these credits even if your income was lower in 2020 due to job loss or underemployment.</p>
