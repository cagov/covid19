<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">Vaccines are highly effective at preventing severe illness from COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccines teach our immune systems how to fight the virus that causes COVID-19. You can still get COVID-19 after vaccination, but your symptoms are likely to be much less severe. Vaccination offers the best protection against new variants, long COVID, hospitalization, and death.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>What we know</h3>



<ul><li>Vaccinations can prevent most COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths.</li><li>The updated COVID-19 vaccine provides protections against the latest  <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID-Variants.aspx" target="_blank">variants</a> of the virus.</li><li>Those with weak immune systems are more likely to experience severe COVID-19 symptoms, even if vaccinated.</li><li>The vaccine can still help you even if you have had COVID-19.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" id="Variants"/>
