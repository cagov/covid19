<h2>What&#8217;s new with vaccines</h2>



<p>Most Californians can get vaccinated for free. Check with your health provider to see if your vaccination is free. There are also programs that can help you cover the cost of the vaccine if you don’t have insurance. <a href="https://myturn.ca.gov/">MyTurn</a> can help you find a location that offers vaccines at no cost.</p>

<h2>How COVID-19 vaccines work</h2>

   <p class="caption">Vaccines are highly effective at preventing severe illness from COVID-19. They can help you avoid hospitalization and death.</p>
    </div>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">COVID-19 vaccines teach our immune systems how to fight the virus that causes COVID-19. You can still get COVID-19 after vaccination, but your symptoms are likely to be much less severe. Vaccination helps you avoid hospitalization and death.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>What we know</h3>



<ul><li>Vaccinations can prevent most COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths.</li><li>Updated COVID-19 vaccines will address many <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID-Variants.aspx" target="_blank">variants</a> of the virus.</li><li>People with weak immune systems are more likely to experience severe COVID-19 symptoms, even if vaccinated.</li><li>The vaccine can still help you even if you have had COVID-19.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" id="Variants"/>



<h2>Vaccines and variants</h2>



<p>Vaccination has proven very effective against COVID-19 variants.&nbsp;The best thing we can do to protect ourselves from getting very sick from COVID-19 is to stay up-to-date with vaccines. </p>



<p>As of September.        , the FDA has authorized the use of the updated Moderna, Pfizer, and Novavax vaccines for all doses given to anyone 6 months of age and older. </p>



<h3>What you need to know&nbsp;</h3>



<ul><li>Any Californian aged 6 months and older can get vaccinated.&nbsp;</li><li>Most people should get one dose of the updated vaccine.</li><li>Children who are 5 years of age may receive two doses of the Moderna vaccine or one dose of the Pfizer vaccine.&nbsp;</li><li>The updated vaccine is designed to address the variants of COVID-19. See <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID-Variants.aspx">variants now present in California</a></li></ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" id="Booster-shots-and-additional-doses"/>



<h2>Side effects</h2>



<p>After COVID-19 vaccination, you may have some mild side effects. These are normal signs that your body is building immunity. More serious side effects rarely happen.</p>



<h3>Mild side effects</h3>



<p>Common mild side effects include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Soreness, redness, or swelling where you got the shot</li><li>Feeling tired, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, or nausea</li></ul>



<p>Side effects may affect your ability to do daily activities, but should go away in a few days. Some people have no side effects.</p>



<h3>Reporting side effects of vaccines</h3>



<p>If you have experienced a side effect after COVID-19 vaccination, you can report it to:</p>



<ul><li><a class="external" href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html">VAERS</a> (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System)</li></ul>



<h3 class="When to call the doctor" id="When-to-call-the-doctor">When to call the doctor</h3>



<p>In most cases, discomfort from pain or fever is a normal sign that your body is building protection. Contact your doctor or healthcare provider if:</p>



<ul><li>The redness or tenderness where you got the shot gets worse after 24 hours</li><li>Your side effects are worrying you or do not seem to be going away after a few days</li></ul>



<p>If you get a COVID-19 vaccine and you have a severe reaction, seek immediate medical care by calling 911. Learn more about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html">COVID-19 vaccines and rare severe allergic reactions</a>.</p>

<h2>Questions and answers</h2>



<h3 id="Getting-vaccinated">Getting vaccinated</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I mix and match COVID-19 vaccines from different manufacturers?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, people ages 6 years and older may mix and match after completing their first vaccination series. In the United States, that means:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Two shots of the original Pfizer vaccine, or&nbsp;one dose of the updated vaccine;</li><li>Two shots of the original Moderna vaccine, or&nbsp;one dose of the updated vaccine;</li><li>Two shots of the Novavax vaccine; or</li><li>One shot of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine (this vaccine is no longer authorized).&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Then, people 6 and older may receive the updated annual vaccine. Some people may prefer the vaccine they got before, and others may prefer to get a different vaccine. CDC recommendations allow for this type of mix-and-match dosing .</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Mixing vaccines is not allowed for children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years. Children in this age group who receive the Moderna vaccine can get the Moderna updated vaccine, and children in this age group who receive the Pfizer vaccine can get the Pfizer updated vaccine.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What if I was vaccinated outside the United States? Can I get a vaccination or additional dose here?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Here’s what the CDC recommends:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>If you were vaccinated outside the U.S. with a vaccine approved or authorized by the FDA, you can get an additional dose.&nbsp;You must follow <a href="https://myturn.ca.gov/en_US/eligibility.html">U.S. eligibility and timing schedules</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>If you got one or both doses of a World Health Organization (WHO) Emergency Use Listed (EUL) vaccine, you can get:&nbsp;<ul><li>A second dose,&nbsp;or</li><li>Additional dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. &nbsp;<br>You must follow <a href="https://myturn.ca.gov/en_US/eligibility.html">U.S. eligibility and timing schedules</a>.</li></ul></li></ul>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>If you got a COVID-19 vaccine that’s not WHO-EUL, you should start over. Get an FDA-authorized vaccine and follow its <a href="https://myturn.ca.gov/en_US/eligibility.html">timing schedule</a>.</li></ul>
