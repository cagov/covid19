<p class="emphasized">COVID-19 vaccination is one of the most important tools to end the COVID-19 pandemic. The State is prioritizing vaccines for equitable distribution to everyone in California who wants it. We expect to have enough supplies to vaccinate most Californians in all 58 counties by summer 2021.</p>

<h3>Vaccine safety is a top priority</h3>



<p>COVID-19 vaccines authorized by the FDA have been shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials.</p>



<p>The U.S. vaccine safety system ensures that all vaccines are as safe as possible. Learn how the federal government is working to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.html">ensure the safety of COVID-19 vaccines</a>.</p>



<p>California formed a <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Scientific-Safety-Review-Workgroup.aspx">Scientific Safety Review Workgroup</a> of experts to ensure the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. This workgroup has confirmed that the COVID-19 vaccines authorized by the FDA are safe and effective.</p>



<h2 id="California's-vaccination-plan">California&#8217;s vaccination plan</h2>



<p>California is allocating COVID-19 vaccines as they become available to ensure equitable distribution. Initially vaccination was limited to healthcare workers and long-term care residents.</p>



<p>The next to be vaccinated will be individuals who:</p>



<ul><li>Have higher risk for severe disease or death (due to age or other factors)</li><li>Are unable to work at home</li><li>Live or work in geographic areas that have been highly impacted</li><li>Are most likely to spread disease to other workers or to the public</li></ul>



<p>These individuals will be prioritized as follows:</p>

<p>Vaccination plans for each county are available at <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/get-local-information/">county websites</a>.</p>



<h3>Vaccine prioritization and outreach by providers</h3>



<p>All vaccination providers should:</p>



<ol><li>Continue vaccinating all persons in Phase 1A</li><li>Begin vaccinating persons 65 years of age or older. Based on available supply, prioritize and target outreach efforts as follows:</li></ol>



<ul><li><strong>Age</strong>, with persons 75 years or older prioritized due to increased risk of mortality and other severe disease</li><li><strong>Occupational risk exposure</strong>, with individuals prioritized who work in sectors with high occupational exposure as listed in Phase 1B, Tier 1</li><li><strong>Residence in vulnerable communities</strong>, as determined by the California Healthy Places Index or comparable local health department knowledge, to address equity and communities disproportionately affected by the pandemic</li></ul>



<h3>Moving through vaccine phases</h3>



<p>Health departments and providers may offer doses promptly to people in lower priority groups when:</p>



<ul><li>Demand subsides in the current groups, or</li><li>Doses are about to expire according to labeling instructions, or</li><li>Doses have been thawed and would otherwise go to waste</li></ul>



<p>To achieve the timely and maximum vaccination of Californians, CDPH recommends the use of 50 percent of doses providers have received as second doses to vaccinate individuals as described above.</p>



<p>Read CDPH <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Vaccine-Prioritization.aspx">Recommendations for Moving Through Vaccine Phases and Tiers</a>.</p>



<h3>How vaccine decisions are made</h3>



<p>A group of experts and a group of community representatives work together to make sure vaccines are prioritized fairly.</p>



<h4>Drafting Guidelines Workgroup</h4>



<p>A Drafting Guidelines Workgroup is developing California-specific guidance for the prioritization and allocation of vaccines.</p>



<p>See CDPH’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Drafting-Guidelines-Workgroup.aspx/">Workgroup page</a> for the vaccine&#8217;s phasing and resource materials.</p>



<h4>Community Vaccine Advisory Committee</h4>



<p>The Community Vaccine Advisory Committee is providing input and feedback to the planning efforts and resolving barriers to equitable vaccine implementation and decision-making.</p>



<p>See CDPH’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Community-Vaccine-Advisory-Committee.aspx/">committee activities page</a> for the upcoming meeting schedule and all meeting materials.</p>



<h2 id="Vaccine-allocation-and-administration">Vaccine allocation and administration</h2>



<p>Once a week, the federal government announces anticipated allocation figures for each state. The number of allocated doses provided by the federal government is a projection and subject to change. Local California providers are required to place their orders which are reviewed by the state and submitted to the federal government. The federal government then authorizes the order and submits the request to the manufacturer. The manufacturer or central distributor ships the vaccine directly to the local California provider. It can take a week or longer between when doses are allocated by the federal government to when they arrive at public health offices or providers and are ready for administration.</p>

<h2 id="How-COVID-19-vaccines-work">How COVID-19 vaccines work</h2>



<p>Vaccines help our immune system fight infections in the future. COVID-19 vaccines will protect us from the virus that causes COVID-19 without having to get the illness.</p>



<p>It typically takes a few weeks after the last dose in a series to become fully protected. On the days after taking the vaccine, you may have a sore arm, aches, fatigue or fever, but these are not harmful. These symptoms signal that your immune system is developing protection from the virus.</p>



<h2 id="Benefits-of-getting-vaccinated">Benefits of getting vaccinated</h2>



<p>COVID-19 vaccines are meant to prevent you from getting COVID-19 and from spreading it to others. The ability of COVID-19 vaccines to protect us from spreading the virus to others is not yet known, but is being studied carefully.</p>

<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Two doses for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, 21 days apart.</li><li>Two doses for the Moderna vaccine, 28 days apart.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How much will the COVID-19 vaccine cost?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Nothing. COVID-19 vaccines, including their administration, are free.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Read more at the Department of Managed Health Care’s <a href="https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/Portals/0/Docs/DO/VaccineFactSheetAccessible.pdf">Know Your Health Care Rights</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Do I need to be a California resident to get COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. Vaccine distribution is based on eligibility irrespective of residency or immigration status.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I register somewhere to get the COVID-19 vaccine? How will I be notified when it’s my turn to get the vaccine, and where to get it?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Every Californian can <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/vaccines/">sign up</a> to see if it&#8217;s their turn to get the COVID-19 vaccine. If you’re not currently eligible, you can sign up to be notified when it’s your turn.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you are a healthcare worker in Los Angeles county you can get your COVID-19 vaccine appointments through the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/vaccines/">state sign up tool</a>. Other counties and front line workers will be added for appointments as they become available.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Some <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/get-local-information/">local health jurisdictions</a> are providing registration and notification services.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">I’ve already had COVID-19. Should I get a COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. At this time, we do not know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19.</p>



<h3 class="h2 mt-5">What to expect after vaccination</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will I still need to wear a mask after getting a COVID-19 vaccine?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. How much protection the COVID-19 vaccines provide under real-life conditions is still unknown. It is important for everyone to continue using all the tools available to us to help stop this pandemic, like:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html"><strong>Staying home and isolating</strong></a><strong> from others when sick</strong></li><li>Wearing masks&nbsp;</li><li>Washing hands often</li><li>Social distancing</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"> Together, COVID-19 vaccination and recommendations for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html">how to protect yourself and others</a> will offer the best protection from getting and spreading COVID-19. We need to understand more about the protection that COVID-19 vaccines provide before we change recommendations on mask use.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Does being vaccinated mean I can visit with loved ones without risking our health?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Even with a vaccine you may still be able to spread COVID-19. Even after vaccination, you should stay home as much as possible:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Isolate if you’re sick&nbsp;</li><li>Wear a mask</li><li>Wash your hands frequently</li><li>Keep your distance from people not in your household</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will the COVID-19 vaccine give me COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. The COVID-19 vaccines do not contain coronavirus and cannot give you COVID-19.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will the COVID-19 vaccine make me test positive for COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. A vaccine will not cause you to test positive on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html">viral tests</a>.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If your body develops an immune response (the goal of vaccination), there is a possibility that you may test positive on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html">antibody tests</a>. Antibody tests indicate that you may have protection against the virus.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How is my privacy protected if I take the COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">California law strictly limits how personal information about those who are vaccinated can be shared. California negotiated with the federal government to limit the required data sharing to only information that will not allow an individual to be identified.</p>

<h3 class="h2 mt-5">Vaccine limitations</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">I have allergies. Should I get the COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It depends. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html">CDC recommends</a> that:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>If you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient in a COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get that specific vaccine.</li><li>If you have had a severe allergic reaction to other vaccines or injections, you should ask your doctor if you should get a COVID-19 vaccine.</li><li>People with a history of severe allergic reactions not related to vaccines or injections may still get vaccinated. People may get vaccinated even with a:<ul><li>History of allergies to oral medications</li><li>Family history of severe allergic reactions</li><li>Milder allergy to vaccines</li></ul></li><li>If you have a severe allergic reaction after getting the first shot, you should not get the second shot.</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can pregnant or breastfeeding women be vaccinated against COVID-19?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Pregnant women have a higher risk for complications from COVID-19 disease. There are no study results available yet on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant women. However, experts believe that the vaccines are unlikely to pose a risk to the woman or the fetus. Pregnant women can talk with a doctor about their risk of COVID-19 disease and how they might benefit from vaccination.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Is the COVID-19 vaccine safe for children?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Currently, COVID-19 vaccines are not recommended for children:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is for ages sixteen and above</li><li>Moderna vaccine is for ages eighteen and above.</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Clinical trials are ongoing to identify a safe vaccine for children.</p>



<h3 class="h2 mt-5">Vaccine choices and effectiveness</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How effective are the COVID-19 vaccines?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The first two vaccines available have shown 94-95% efficacy against a person becoming ill with COVID-19.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Is one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine effective?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Getting the second dose of the vaccine will make it more effective. When you receive your first dose, you should schedule the second dose appointment before leaving your doctor’s office.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will I have a choice between the various COVID-19 vaccines?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It depends. Check with your health care provider about which vaccine they have available.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will you make the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory?&nbsp;</h4>
