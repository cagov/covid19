<h2 class="COVID-19 vaccines are here" id="COVID-19-vaccines-are-here">COVID-19 vaccines are here</h2>



<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued <a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines">Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for two COVID-19 vaccines</a>. More vaccines may be authorized early next year.</p>

<h3>Vaccine safety is a top priority</h3>



<p>COVID-19 vaccines authorized by FDA have been carefully evaluated in clinical trials.</p>



<p>The U.S. vaccine safety system ensures that all vaccines are as safe as possible. Learn how the federal government is working to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.html">ensure the safety of COVID-19 vaccines</a>.</p>



<p>To ensure the COVID-19 vaccine meets safety requirements, California formed a <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Scientific-Safety-Review-Workgroup.aspx">Scientific Safety Review Workgroup</a> to provide recommendations to California leadership and build public confidence in vaccine safety.</p>



<p>The Workgroup completed their concurrent and thorough review of the federal process and have confirmed that the COVID-19 vaccines authorized by FDA are safe and effective.</p>



<h2 class="Who gets vaccinated first" id="When-can-I-get-vaccinated">When can I get vaccinated?</h2>



<p>California will distribute and administer vaccines as soon as they are available. California will be transparent, careful, and equitable in its vaccine distribution.</p>



<p>Initially vaccine supply will be very limited. At first, vaccines will be provided to healthcare workers and long-term care residents in accordance with the <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/CDPH-Allocation-Guidelines-for-COVID-19-Vaccine-During-Phase-1A-Recommendations.aspx">CDPH Allocation Guidelines</a>.</p>



<h3>How vaccine decisions are made</h3>



<p>Two groups work together to make sure vaccines are distributed fairly.</p>



<h4>Drafting Guidelines Workgroup</h4>



<p>A Drafting Guidelines Workgroup is developing California-specific guidance for the prioritization and allocation of vaccines when supplies are limited.</p>

<h4>Community Vaccine Advisory Committee</h4>



<p>The Community Vaccine Advisory Committee is providing input and feedback to the planning efforts and resolving barriers to equitable vaccine implementation and decision-making.</p>

<h2 id="How-COVID-19-vaccines-work">How COVID-19 vaccines work</h2>



<p>Vaccines help our immune system fight infections in the future. COVID-19 vaccines will protect us from the virus that causes COVID-19 without having to get the illness.</p>



<p>It typically takes a few weeks after the last dose in a series to become fully protected. Sometimes vaccination can cause mild fever or cold-like symptoms, but these are not harmful.</p>



<h2 id="Benefits-of-getting-vaccinated">Benefits of getting vaccinated</h2>



<p>COVID-19 vaccines are meant to prevent you from getting COVID-19 and from spreading it to others. The ability of COVID-19 vaccines to protect us from spreading the virus to others is not yet known, but is being studied carefully.</p>



<h2 id="Busting-myths-about-vaccination">Busting myths about vaccination</h2>



<h3>COVID-19 vaccines will not give you COVID-19</h3>



<p>COVID-19 vaccination can’t cause COVID-19. The goal of the vaccines&nbsp; is to teach our immune systems how to fight the virus that causes COVID-19. Learn more about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/about-vaccines/how-they-work.html">how COVID-19 vaccines work</a>.</p>



<h3>COVID-19 vaccines will not cause you to test positive on COVID-19 viral tests</h3>



<p>Vaccines won’t cause you to test positive on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html">viral tests</a>, which are used to see if you have a current infection.</p>



<p>If your body develops an immune response, which is the goal of vaccination, there is a possibility you may test positive on some <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html">antibody tests</a>. Antibody tests indicate you had a previous infection and that you may have some level of protection against the virus. Experts are currently looking at how COVID-19 vaccination may affect antibody testing results.</p>



<h3>People who have gotten sick with COVID-19 may still benefit from getting vaccinated</h3>



<p>People are advised to get a COVID-19 vaccine even if they have been sick with COVID-19 before. This is due to the severe health risks associated with COVID-19 and the fact that re-infection with COVID-19 is possible.</p>



<p>At this time, we do not know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19.</p>



<p>We won’t know how long immunity produced by vaccination lasts until we have a vaccine and more data on how well it works.</p>



<h3>Vaccination can help prevent getting sick with COVID-19</h3>



<p>While many people with COVID-19 have only a mild illness, others may get a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">severe illness</a> or even die. There is no way to know how COVID-19 will affect you, even if you are not at <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/index.html">increased risk of severe complications</a>. COVID-19 vaccination helps protect you without having to get the disease.

<h2 id="Questions-and-answers">Questions and answers</h2>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will I still need to wear a mask after getting a COVID-19 vaccine?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. How much protection the COVID-19 vaccines provide under real-life conditions is still unknown. It is important for everyone to continue using all the tools available to us to help stop this pandemic, like:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html"><strong>Staying home and isolating</strong></a><strong> from others when sick</strong></li><li>Wearing masks&nbsp;</li><li>Washing hands often</li><li>Social distancing</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"> Together, COVID-19 vaccination and recommendations for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html">how to protect yourself and others</a> will offer the best protection from getting and spreading COVID-19. We need to understand more about the protection that COVID-19 vaccines provide before we change recommendations on mask use.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How many COVID-19 vaccine doses are needed?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Two shots.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How much will the COVID-19 vaccine cost?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Vaccines purchased with U.S. taxpayer dollars will be given to the American people at no cost. </p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Read more at DMHC’s <a href="https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/Portals/0/Docs/DO/VaccineFactSheetAccessible.pdf">Know Your Health Care Rights</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will you make the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory? </h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No, there is no mandatory vaccination requirement from either the state or federal government. While vaccine doses will be limited in supply at first, we hope that by educating Californians about the safety and efficacy of a COVID-19 vaccine, we can encourage voluntary adoption of the vaccine.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How is my privacy protected if I take the COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">California law strictly limits how personal information about those who are vaccinated can be shared. California negotiated with the federal government to limit the required data sharing to only information that will not allow an individual to be identified.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Read more at CDPH’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/California-Data-Use-Agreement.aspx">California Data Use Agreement and Frequently Asked Questions</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">I have allergies. Should I get the COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It depends. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html">CDC recommends</a> that:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>If you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient in a COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get that specific vaccine.</li><li>If you have had a severe allergic reaction to other vaccines or injections, you should ask your doctor if you should get a COVID-19 vaccine.</li><li>People with a history of severe allergic reactions not related to vaccines or injections may still get vaccinated. People may get vaccinated even with a:<ul><li>History of allergies to oral medications</li><li>Family history of severe allergic reactions</li><li>Milder allergy to vaccines</li></ul></li><li>If you have a severe allergic reaction after getting the first shot, you should not get the second shot.</li></ul>
