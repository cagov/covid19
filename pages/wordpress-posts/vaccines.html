<br id="Who-can-get-vaccinated">



<h2>Who can get vaccinated</h2>



<p><strong>Any Californian aged 5 and up can get vaccinated, for free.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your insurance or immigration status does not matter. No one will ask about your immigration status when you get vaccinated.</p>



<h3>Vaccinations for kids</h3>



<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">Are vaccines safe for children aged 5 and older?</div>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine is <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use">authorized for kids aged 12 and up</a>.&nbsp; A lower dose of the Pfizer vaccine is now <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-authorizes-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use-children-5-through-11-years-age">authorized for kids aged 5 to 11</a>.</p>



<p>Both were found to be safe and effective in protecting children from COVID-19 in clinical trials.</p>

<h2>How COVID-19 vaccines work</h2>



<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">How do COVID-19 vaccines work?</div>



<div>
<img src="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/img/Women-getting-vaccinated.jpg" alt="Illustration of a women getting a bandage on her arm after vaccination" style="width: 920px;">
      
   <p class="caption">Vaccines are highly effective against severe COVID-19. No fully-vaccinated person died due to COVID-19 during clinical trials of the three authorized vaccines.
</p>
    </div>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">COVID-19 vaccines teach our immune systems how to fight the virus that causes COVID-19. It takes a few weeks after vaccination for the body to build immunity against the virus. That means it is possible you could still get COVID-19 just after vaccination.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>What we know</h3>



<ul><li>Vaccinations can prevent nearly all COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths. <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Post-Vaccine-COVID19-Cases.aspx">Post-vaccination cases</a> are extremely rare.</li><li>Vaccinations reduce the spread of COVID-19.</li><li>COVID-19 vaccines are effective against <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID-Variants.aspx">variants</a> of the virus currently circulating in the United States, including the Delta variant.</li><li>People with weakened immune systems, including those who take immunosuppressive medications, may not be protected even if fully vaccinated.</li></ul>



<h3>What we’re still learning</h3>



<ul><li>How long COVID-19 vaccine protection lasts.</li></ul>



<h3>Once you’re vaccinated</h3>



<p>When you’re fully vaccinated, you can return to activities you did before the pandemic. But stay aware of <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID-19-Public-Health-Recommendations-for-Fully-Vaccinated-People.aspx">public health recommendations</a> that still apply to you.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator" id="Variants"/>



<h2>Variants</h2>



<p>Vaccination has proven very effective against COVID-19 variants like Delta. We don’t yet know how effective it will be against emerging variants like Omicron.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The best thing we can do to limit virus spread and mutation is to:</p>



<ul><li>Get vaccinated</li><li>Get your booster if you’re eligible</li></ul>



<p>More info about COVID-19 variants from CDPH:</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator" id="Booster-shots-and-additional-doses"/>



<h2>Booster shots and additional doses</h2>



<h3>Booster shots</h3>



<p>Booster shots are now available for everyone 18 and older.</p>



<p>Get a booster shot as soon as you’re eligible:</p>



<ul><li>If you got a <strong>Pfizer or Moderna</strong> vaccine, get a booster shot after 6 months</li><li>If you got a <strong>Johnson &amp; Johnson</strong> vaccine, get a booster shot after 2 months</li></ul>



<p>Your booster shot can be a different vaccine brand than you received before, as long as you completed your original vaccination series (one dose of Johnson &amp; Johnson or two doses of Pfizer or Moderna).</p>



<p>To book your booster shot or find a walk-in clinic, visit <a href="https://myturn.ca.gov/">My Turn</a>.</p>



<p>Read <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Pfizer-COVID-19-Vaccine-Boosters.aspx">more booster facts</a> and <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Vaccine-Booster-QA.aspx">booster questions and answers</a> from CDPH.</p>



<h3>Additional doses</h3>



<p>Additional doses of Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines are now available for those with moderately to severely compromised immune systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This includes people who:</p>



<ul><li>Get <strong>active cancer treatment</strong> for tumors or cancers of the blood</li><li>Got an <strong>organ transplant</strong> and are taking medicine to suppress the immune system</li><li>Got a <strong>stem cell transplant</strong> within the last 2 years or are taking medicine to suppress the immune system</li><li>Have <strong>moderate or severe primary immunodeficiency</strong> (such as DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome)</li><li>Have <strong>advanced or untreated HIV infection</strong></li><li>Get <strong>active treatment with high-dose corticosteroids</strong> or other drugs that suppress immune response</li></ul>



<p>Talk to your doctor to see if getting an additional dose is right for you. If you meet these criteria, you can book your shot at <a href="https://myturn.ca.gov/">My Turn</a>.</p>



<p>See <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/ThirdVaccineDoseQandA.aspx">questions and answers about additional doses</a>.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" id="Digital-vaccine-record"/>



<h2 id="Get-a-digital-copy-of-your-vaccine-record">Digital vaccine record&nbsp;</h2>



<p>You can now get a digital copy of your vaccination record. This is called the <a href="https://myvaccinerecord.cdph.ca.gov/">Digital COVID-19 Vaccine Record</a> (DCVR). It’s available to you if:</p>



<ul><li>You got vaccinated in California, and&nbsp;</li><li>Your information matches what is recorded in the state’s immunization systems.</li></ul>



<p>&nbsp;To get your vaccine record:</p>



<ul><li>Go to <a href="https://myvaccinerecord.cdph.ca.gov/">myvaccinerecord.cdph.ca.gov</a></li><li>Enter your:<ul><li>Name</li><li>Date of birth</li><li>Email or phone number you gave when vaccinated</li><li>Create a four-digit PIN</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>This digital copy can be used as proof of vaccination.&nbsp;</p>



<p>See <a href="https://myvaccinerecord.cdph.ca.gov/faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a> to learn more about your digital vaccine record.</p>



<h3>If you have trouble getting your record</h3>



<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">How can I fix errors in my vaccination record?</div>



<p>If you couldn’t get your vaccine record, you may need to correct or add some information. Follow the troubleshooting tips at <a href="http://cdph.ca.gov/covidvaccinerecord">cdph.ca.gov/covidvaccinerecord</a>.</p>



<p>What might prevent you from getting your COVID-19 vaccination record:</p>



<ul><li>Your vaccination site does not report to the state’s immunization systems</li><li>Your vaccination site didn’t report your vaccination</li><li>The information you entered doesn’t match your record in the registry</li></ul>

<hr class="wp-block-separator bd-top-darkblue" id="Side-effects"/>



<h2>Side effects</h2>



<p>After COVID-19 vaccination, you may have some mild side effects. These are normal signs that your body is building immunity. More serious side effects rarely happen.</p>



<h3>Mild side effects</h3>



<p>Common mild side effects include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Soreness, redness, or swelling where you got the shot</li><li>Feeling tired, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, or nausea</li></ul>



<p>Side effects may affect your ability to do daily activities, but should go away in a few days. Some people have no side effects.</p>



<h3>Rare but serious side effects</h3>



<h4>Blood clots</h4>



<p>Rarely, women under 50 who get the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine have a risk of blood clots with low platelets. This risk is not seen in other COVID-19 vaccines. Read CDPH’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/JnJ_factsheet.pdf">Fact Sheet: Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 Vaccine Benefits and Risks</a>.</p>



<h4>Myocarditis and pericarditis</h4>



<p>Some young people have developed inflammation of heart muscle or membrane after getting a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. Despite this, the CDC believes that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the risks. Read more in these CDPH fact sheets:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Pfizer-Factsheet.en.pdf">Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine Benefits and Risks</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Moderna-Factsheet-en.pdf">Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine Benefits and Risks</a></li></ul>



<h3>Reporting side effects of vaccines</h3>



<p>If you have experienced a side effect after COVID-19 vaccination, you can report it to:</p>



<ul><li><a class="external" href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html">VAERS</a> (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System)</li><li><a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html">V-safe</a> (After Vaccination Health Checker)</li></ul>



<h3 class="When to call the doctor" id="When-to-call-the-doctor">When to call the doctor</h3>



<p>In most cases, discomfort from pain or fever is a normal sign that your body is building protection. Contact your doctor or healthcare provider if:</p>



<ul><li>The redness or tenderness where you got the shot gets worse after 24 hours</li><li>Your side effects are worrying you or do not seem to be going away after a few days</li></ul>



<p>If you get a COVID-19 vaccine and you have a severe reaction, seek immediate medical care by calling 911. Learn more about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html">COVID-19 vaccines and rare severe allergic reactions</a>.</p>

<h2>Questions and answers</h2>



<h3 id="Getting-vaccinated">Getting vaccinated</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>How many COVID-19 vaccine doses do I need, and how far apart should I get them?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Ideally, you’d get:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Two doses for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, 21 days apart</li><li>Two doses for the Moderna vaccine, 28 days apart&nbsp;</li><li>Just one dose of the Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen vaccine</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If two shots are needed,<strong> get your second shot as close to the recommended interval as possible</strong>. If you can’t get it at the recommended interval, you can get your second dose up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose. We have limited data on how well these vaccines work beyond this window. But if you get the second dose after 42 days, there is no need to start over.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Children aged 5-11 who get the lower-dose Pfizer vaccine should also get two shots 21 days apart.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Booster or additional doses of these vaccines are available for those 18 and older who are eligible. Read <a href="#Booster-shots-and-additional-doses">Booster shots and additional doses</a> to see if you are eligible.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Only a single booster dose is recommended at this time. You should not repeat a vaccine series.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I mix and match COVID-19 vaccines from different manufacturers?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, after you complete your first vaccination series. In the United States, that means two shots of the Pfizer vaccine 21 days apart, or two shots of the Moderna vaccine 28 days apart, or one shot of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.<br><br>Then you may choose another vaccine to receive as a booster dose. Some people may prefer the vaccine they got before, and others may prefer to get a different booster. CDC recommendations now allow for this type of mix-and-match dosing for booster doses.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How much will the COVID-19 vaccine cost?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Nothing. COVID-19 vaccines and their administration are free to the public.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Read more at the Department of Managed Health Care’s <a class="external" href="https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/Portals/0/Docs/DO/VaccineFactSheetAccessible.pdf">Know Your Health Care Rights</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Do I need to be a California resident to get COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. Vaccine eligibility is based on age. Residency or immigration status does not matter.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How do I cancel or reschedule my vaccine appointment through My Turn?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you need to cancel or reschedule your appointment, you can do so on the <a href="https://myturn.ca.gov/manage">Manage your appointments</a> page.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You will be asked to confirm your appointment with:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Your appointment confirmation number, and&nbsp;</li><li>Either your cell phone number or your email address.</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">I’ve already had COVID-19. Should I get a COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Research has not yet shown how long you are protected from getting COVID-19 again after you recover from COVID-19. Evidence is emerging that people get better protection by being fully vaccinated compared with having had COVID-19. One <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7032e1.htm?s_cid=mm7032e1_e&amp;ACSTrackingID=USCDC_921-DM63289&amp;ACSTrackingLabel=MMWR%20Early%20Release%20-%20Vol.%2070%2C%20August%206%2C%202021&amp;deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM63289">study</a> showed that unvaccinated people who already had COVID-19 are more than two times as likely than fully vaccinated people to get COVID-19 again.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I get vaccinated against COVID-19 while I am currently sick with COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. Wait until you have recovered and have met the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html">criteria for ending isolation</a>. This guidance also applies to people who get COVID-19 between their first and second dose.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will COVID-19 vaccine sites be accessible?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. All vaccine clinics in California are required to meet ADA requirements.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How do I get a COVID-19 vaccine at home if I am unable to travel to a vaccine site?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Check with your healthcare provider, local health department, or local pharmacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you cannot leave your home, you can state this when booking on <a href="http://cert1.mail-west.com/rUyeH/mc7rm/myuzjan/rUgt/dk9o81/erho/nv6ok/51rUaxx">myturn.ca.gov</a> or when calling <a href="tel:1-833-422-4255">1-833-422-4255</a>. If eligible, your local health jurisdiction will arrange for your in-home vaccination.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How do I get transportation to a vaccine site?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Read CDPH’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Vaccine-Record-Guidelines-Standards.aspx">Vaccine Record Guidelines &amp; Standards</a> for complete details.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What does it mean to be “fully vaccinated”?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">People are considered fully vaccinated for COVID-19:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Two weeks after they receive the second dose in a 2-dose series (Pfizer or Moderna), or</li><li>Two weeks after they receive a single-dose vaccine (Johnson &amp; Johnson).</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Booster doses are not required to be considered fully vaccinated. But we recommend you get a booster as soon as you’re eligible to get the most protection from COVID-19.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">See CDPH’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID-19-Public-Health-Recommendations-for-Fully-Vaccinated-People.aspx">COVID-19 Public Health Recommendations for Fully Vaccinated People</a> for details.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will the COVID-19 vaccine make me test positive for COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. A vaccine will not cause you to test positive on <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html">viral tests</a>.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If your body develops an immune response, you may test positive on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html">antibody tests</a>. This shows that you may have protection against the virus.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How is my privacy protected if I take the COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">California law strictly limits how personal information about those who are vaccinated can be shared. California negotiated with the federal government to limit the required data sharing to only information that will not allow an individual to be identified.</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Booster shots or additional doses will not automatically show on your digital vaccine record. You will need to go to the <a href="https://myvaccinerecord.cdph.ca.gov/">Digital COVID-19 Vaccine Record</a> portal to get a new QR code.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">We recommend waiting 14 days for your new dose to show up in the California Immunization Registry before you try to get a new QR code.</p>



<h3 id="Vaccination-for-children">Vaccination for children</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>Do providers need parental consent before administering&nbsp;a COVID-19 vaccine to a minor?&nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Before vaccinating a minor, vaccine providers must get consent from a:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Parent,&nbsp;</li><li>Legal guardian, or&nbsp;</li><li>Other adults having legal custody.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">There are some exceptions:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=FAM&amp;sectionNum=7050.">Emancipated minors</a> do not need the consent of a parent or guardian to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.</li><li>Providers may accept written consent from a parent or legal guardian of an unaccompanied minor. This consent must verify the parent/guardian has received the<a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download"> Pfizer EUA Fact Sheet</a>.</li><li>Phone or video consent is acceptable. The parent/guardian must confirm that they received the<a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download"> Pfizer EUA Fact Sheet</a>. Reading the fact sheet to the parent/guardian is an option.</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Families should check with their vaccine provider on acceptable forms of consent. See CDPH’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Pfizer-Vaccine-Minor-Consent-Guidance.aspx">Pfizer Vaccine Minor Consent Guidance</a> for more details.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Why should I vaccinate my child?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Cases in children are increasing. It is important to get young people vaccinated to prevent more hospitalizations and deaths.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Vaccinations may stop the spread of coronavirus variants. They can also shrink the pool of people vulnerable to COVID-19. By getting children 5 and up vaccinated, families can be safer as we get back to doing the things we love.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">My child has had reactions to other vaccines. Should they still get the vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, unless they have had anaphylactic-type reactions to components of the Pfizer vaccine.<strong> </strong>Allergic reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine are rare. If your child has severe allergies or flu vaccine reactions, talk to their doctor before getting them vaccinated. <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Is there an increased vaccination risk to children who have pre-existing conditions like asthma?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Youth aged 5 and up can still receive the COVID-19 vaccine even if they have health conditions. Talk to your doctor or clinic about your child’s specific conditions.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will my child have to get vaccinated to attend in-person schooling?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Students will be required to be vaccinated for in-person learning starting the term following FDA full approval of the vaccine for their grade span (7-12 and K-6). Vaccination will protect young people against more-contagious coronavirus variants and COVID-19. The COVID-19 vaccine will be added to the list of already required vaccinations for school, including vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella and more.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Why did it take longer for the COVID-19 vaccine to be approved for youth?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Vaccine trials commonly begin with older, more vulnerable populations and then extend to younger ages. This phased eligibility approach balances the need for both safety and speed.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Comprehensive clinical trials in more than 4,500 children ages 5-11 demonstrate the COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective in this age group, resulting in a strong antibody response in children who received the vaccines.</p>



<h3 id="Vaccines-allocation-and-distribution">Vaccinations for employees</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">I&#8217;m an employer and want to help my employees get vaccinated. How do I do that?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The <a href="https://saferatwork.covid19.ca.gov/employer-vaccination-toolkit/">Employer Vaccination Toolkit</a> provides all the information you need to:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Partner with local providers for offsite vaccination events</li><li>Request a worksite mobile clinic</li><li>Help employees find and book vaccination appointments</li><li>Share and promote resources that support employees in getting vaccinated</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>Can an employer require COVID-19 vaccination for all employees entering a workplace?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, if certain requirements are met. Under the ADA, an employer may insist all employees to meet a standard that is job-related and consistent with business necessity. This could include a safety-related standard requiring COVID-19 vaccination.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">But if an employee cannot meet such a standard because of a disability, the employer may not require that they comply. The exception to that is if the employee’s non-compliance poses a threat to their health or safety or that of others in the workplace.</p>

<h3 id="Vaccine-limitations">Vaccine limitations</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">If I get a COVID-19 vaccine, will I still need a flu shot this fall?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. COVID-19 vaccine does not provide protection against flu.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Are there certain populations who should not get a COVID-19 vaccine? <strong>What about people with allergies?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html">CDC recommends</a> that:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>If you have had a severe or immediate reaction to any ingredient in an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, do not get the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. Ask your doctor if you can get the Janssen vaccine.</li><li>If you have had a severe or immediate reaction to any ingredient in the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, do not get the Janssen vaccine. Ask your doctor if you can get the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine.</li><li>If you had an immediate allergic reaction after getting the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, do not get the second dose.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>If you are allergic to PEG, you should not get the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine.

<h4 class="wp-accordion">If I&#8217;m pregnant or breastfeeding, should I get the COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. The CDC states that pregnant and lactating individuals can receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Experts have no vaccination safety concerns for pregnant or lactating women or their babies. The COVID-19 vaccines do not contain the live virus, so they cannot cause COVID-19.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Pregnant people are more likely to get severely ill with COVID-19 than those who are not pregnant. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy can protect you from severe illness. Talk to your doctor if you have questions about getting a COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you’re getting a booster shot, you can choose to get a different vaccine brand than you originally got.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Are the COVID-19 vaccines FDA-approved?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">One is. Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, now named Comirnaty, has full FDA approval for use in anyone aged 16 and up.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The FDA can allow using vaccines before full approval. This is called an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). It lets us respond quickly to emergency situations like a pandemic. EUAs still involve rigorous testing for safety and effectiveness.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines have EUAs for use in anyone aged 18 and up. The Pfizer vaccine has an EUA for use in children aged 12 to 15. The lower-dose Pfizer vaccine has an EUA for use in children aged 5 to 11. </p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Are the COVID-19 vaccines mandatory?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. Neither the state or federal government requires you to get vaccinated. We hope Californians will opt for vaccination once they see how safe and effective it is.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Do I need to be vaccinated to visit a healthcare facility?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Visitors to hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and intermediate care facilities must show proof that they are fully vaccinated. If they are not fully vaccinated, they may only visit if they show proof of a negative COVID-19 test within the previous 72 hours.<br><br>All visitors, no matter their vaccination status, must wear masks and appropriate PPE and keep social distance during their visit.

<h4 class="wp-accordion">How can I convince my family and friends to take a COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Talking with family and friends about the benefits of getting a COVID-19 vaccine can be hard. Try to listen without judgement and identify the root of their concerns. Things to remember to help open the discussion include:</p>
