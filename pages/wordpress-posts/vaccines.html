<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">Who qualifies  for vaccination as Individuals at higher risk?</div>



<h3 class="wp-accordion js-qa js-qa-answer" id="Vaccinating-those-at-higher-risk">Individuals at higher risk</h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content js-qa js-qa-answer">Vaccinations are available for the estimated 4.4 million people in California at higher risk for serious COVID-19 illness. This includes those with certain significant high-risk medical conditions, disabilities, illness, living spaces, or work environments.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content js-qa js-qa-answer">Individuals with these conditions are strongly encouraged to check first with your usual health care provider. They can advise if you can get your vaccination with them, or in an alternate clinical setting.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content js-qa js-qa-answer"><strong>Health conditions</strong></p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content js-qa js-qa-answer">Healthcare providers may use their clinical judgement to vaccinate individuals aged 16-64 who are <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Provider-Bulletin-2-12-21.aspx">deemed to be at highest risk<strong> </strong></a>to get very sick from COVID-19 due to the following severe health conditions:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content js-qa js-qa-answer"><li><strong>Cancer</strong>, current with weakened immune system</li><li><strong>Chronic kidney disease</strong>, stage 4 or above</li><li><strong>Chronic pulmonary disease, </strong>oxygen dependent</li><li><strong>Down syndrome</strong></li><li><strong>Solid organ transplant, </strong>leading to a weakened immune system</li><li><strong>Pregnancy</strong></li><li><strong>Sickle cell disease</strong></li><li><strong>Heart conditions</strong>, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathies (but not hypertension)</li><li><strong>Severe obesity</strong> (Body Mass Index ≥ 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</li><li><strong>Type 2 diabetes mellitus</strong> with hemoglobin A1c level greater than 7.5%</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content js-qa js-qa-answer"><strong>Disabilities or illness</strong></p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content js-qa js-qa-answer">Healthcare providers may also vaccinate individuals with&nbsp; developmental or other severe disabilities or illness if:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content js-qa js-qa-answer"><li>The individual is likely to develop severe life-threatening illness or death from COVID-19 infection</li><li>Acquiring COVID-19 will limit the individual&#8217;s ability to get ongoing care or services vital to their well-being and survival</li><li>Providing adequate and timely COVID care will be particularly challenging as a result of the individual&#8217;s disability.</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content js-qa js-qa-answer">These include people with a range of physical and behavioral disabilities, such as:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content js-qa js-qa-answer"><li>People with serious mental illness (SMI)</li><li>Those with serious substance use disorder (SUD)</li><li>All enrolled consumers of:<ul><li>Regional centers</li><li>Independent living centers&nbsp;</li><li>In-home supportive services</li><li>Community-based adult services/adult day health centers</li><li>Medi-Cal HIV/AIDS waiver&nbsp;</li><li>Medi-Cal home and community-based alternatives waiver</li><li>Medi-Cal assisted living waiver</li><li>Programs of all-inclusive care for the elderly&nbsp;</li><li>California children’s services program (if the child is 16-21 years old)</li><li>California genetically handicapped persons program</li></ul></li></ul>

<p class="wp-accordion-content js-qa js-qa-answer"><strong>Congregate living spaces&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content js-qa js-qa-answer">Individuals who live or work in a congregate residential setting are eligible for COVID-19 vaccination, which includes:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content js-qa js-qa-answer"><li>Incarceration/detention facility</li><li>Homeless shelter</li><li>Behavioral health facility.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content js-qa js-qa-answer">These settings are at high risk for outbreaks and have a concentration of individuals with high-risk chronic health conditions. This includes people experiencing homelessness, who may transition into congregate settings at short notice.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content js-qa js-qa-answer"><strong><strong><strong>Transportation and logistics –&nbsp;public transit/airport and commercial airlines</strong></strong></strong></p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content js-qa js-qa-answer">Public transit workers, including airport workers for commercial airlines (but not private airplanes), will be eligible for COVID-19 vaccination. They are at high risk for occupational exposure, and maintaining continuity of transportation operations is critical.</p>

<h3 class="wp-accordion" id="Equity-framework"><strong>Equity for hardest-hit communities</strong></h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">California must end the COVID-19 pandemic as quickly and effectively as possible by vaccinating those&nbsp;most at risk of serious outcomes and those who have been most exposed at work or in their daily lives. This will protect not just those who are vaccinated, but reduce additional community transmission.&nbsp;By targeting vaccines to those who most need them, we can also begin to&nbsp;<a class="external" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/BlueprintForSaferEconomy.aspx">safely reopen activities</a> across our economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The state will continue to double the amount of vaccine allocated to the lowest HPI quartile as <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/03/04/california-leads-with-public-health-and-vaccine-equity-to-safely-and-sustainably-reopen/">announced on March 4</a> for four weeks beginning the week of March 22.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Currently, the state<a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR21-072.aspx"> is directing 40% of vaccine doses to the hardest-hit areas of the state</a> based on the lowest quartile of the Public Health Alliance of Southern California’s Healthy Places Index (HPI). Our next goal is to reach 4 million vaccine doses administered to the hardest-hit communities in the state, which represents about 25 percent of eligible Californians.</p>



<h2 id="How-to-get-vaccinated">How to get vaccinated</h2>



<p>How you will be vaccinated depends on when you are eligible and the available supply at the time you are eligible.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">How can I get a COVID-19 vaccine appointment or vaccination locations?</div>



<div style="display:none;"><!-- Register --></div>

<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">People with a high chance of exposure, high-risk, and those 65 or older are eligible for vaccination and can schedule appointments now. If you’re eligible, and live or work in certain counties, you can schedule an appointment through My Turn. Appointments are available in Spanish.</p>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">If it’s not your turn yet or appointments are not available, you can <strong>register to be notified</strong> when you’re eligible or when appointments open up.</p>



<p><strong>Geographic requirements by county</strong></p>



<p>Due to high demand and limited supply, each county is setting their own geographic requirements. Most limit vaccination to those who live or work within the county. Appointments may be cancelled if you don’t meet the local requirements. Check the county’s vaccination website to make sure you are eligible before making an appointment.</p>

<h2 id="How-vaccines-work">How vaccines work</h2>



<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">How do COVID-19 vaccines work?</div>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">COVID-19 vaccines teach our immune systems how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19. It typically takes a few weeks after vaccination for the body to build protection (immunity) against the virus. That means it is possible a person could still get COVID-19 just after vaccination, because the vaccine has not had enough time to build immunity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the vaccine you got requires two shots, be sure to get both doses so it can work fully.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="Vaccine-safety">Vaccine safety&nbsp;</h3>



<p>COVID-19 vaccines authorized by the FDA have been shown to be <a class="external" href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained">safe</a> and <a class="external" href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines">effective</a> in clinical trials. These vaccines were authorized only after it was found that they make it substantially less likely you’ll get COVID-19.</p>



<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">How effective are the COVID-19 vaccines?</div>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">The authorized vaccines are up to 95% effective against a person becoming ill with COVID-19.</p>



<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">Is the COVID-19 vaccine safe?</div>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">The U.S. vaccine safety system ensures that all vaccines are as safe as possible. Learn how the federal government is working to <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.html">ensure the safety of COVID-19 vaccines</a>.</p>



<h4>Safety monitoring after vaccination</h4>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">Millions of people in the United States have received COVID-19 vaccines. These vaccines have undergone the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history, using both <a class="external" href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/">established</a> and <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html">new safety monitoring systems</a>. These vaccines cannot give you COVID-19. Learn more <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/facts.html">facts about COVID-19 vaccines.</a></p>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer"><a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html">Results from monitoring efforts are reassuring</a>. Many people have reported only mild side effects after COVID-19 vaccination. Some people have no side effects.</p>



<h4>You cannot get COVID-19 from the vaccine</h4>



<p>The vaccines do not contain coronavirus and cannot give you COVID-19.</p>

<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">Why should I get a COVID-19 vaccine?</div>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">COVID-19 vaccines are effective at keeping you from getting COVID-19. But they have other benefits, too:</p>



<ul class="js-qa js-qa-answer"><li>In the rare case that you do still get COVID-19, the vaccine may help keep you from getting seriously ill.&nbsp;</li><li>Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you, <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/index.html">particularly people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19</a>.</li><li>COVID-19 vaccination is a safer way to help build immunity. COVID-19 can have <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">serious, life-threatening complications,</a> and there is no way to know how COVID-19 will affect you.</li></ul>

<h2 id="What-to-expect-after-vaccination">What to expect after vaccination</h2>



<h3>You may have mild side effects</h3>



<p>After COVID-19 vaccination, you may have some side effects. These are normal signs that your body is building immunity. Your arm may hurt where you got your shot or you may have redness or swelling. You may be tired or have a headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, or nausea. &nbsp;They may affect your ability to do daily activities, but should go away in a few days. Some people have no side effects. Learn more about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html">Possible Side Effects After Getting a COVID-19 Vaccine</a>.</p>

<h2 id="California-vaccines-dashboard">Vaccination progress dashboards</h2>



<p>These dashboards make vaccination data transparent and accessible to all Californians. They are updated daily.</p>



<p>Initially, vaccination was limited to healthcare workers and long-term care residents. Hence the data reflects those populations more than other California residents.</p>



<p>The dashboards report vaccines administered by the county of residence. Where the county of residence was not reported, the county where vaccinated is used. This applies to less than 1% of vaccination records. The sum of county-level vaccinations does not equal statewide total vaccinations because some out-of-state residents are vaccinated in California.</p>

<h3 class="pt-5">Vaccination and community health conditions (Vaccine Equity Metric)</h3>

<p>This graph compares COVID-19 vaccinations among four different levels of community health. </p>

<p>It uses the Public  Health Alliance of Southern California’s Healthy Places Index (HPI) measures in a zip code area that can impact health, like income, education, and access to health care. Areas are then given a score, ranging from least healthy community conditions (Quartile 1) to most healthy community conditions (Quartile 4). The Vaccine Equity Metric also creates scores for areas that don’t have an HPI score.
</p><p>
  Data below show the progress of vaccination in each of the four quartiles.

<h2 id="Questions-and-answers">Questions and answers</h2>



<h3 id="Vaccines-allocation-and-distribution">Vaccines allocation and distribution</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion" id="Allocation">How are vaccines allocated?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Once a week, the federal government announces anticipated allocation figures for each state. The number of allocated doses provided by the federal government is a projection and subject to change.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Using the federal allocation as a starting point, the state considers recommendations from the leadership of local health jurisdictions and the state’s third-party administrator, Blue Shield of California, to make decisions about how best to allocate vaccine supply in the state for efficient and equitable delivery of vaccinations. In addition to adjusting allocations to target eligible populations the state <a class="external" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR21-072.aspx">is directing 40% of vaccine doses to the hardest hit areas of the state</a> based on the lowest quartile of the Healthy Places Index (HPI). See the <a class="external" href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/ca.open.data#!/vizhome/COVID-19VaccineAllocationbyLHJ/AllocationbyCounty">most recent allocation</a><strong>.</strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion" id="Distribution">How are vaccines distributed?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Local providers place orders which are reviewed by the state and submitted to the federal government. The federal government then authorizes the order and submits the request to the manufacturer. The manufacturer or central distributor ships the vaccine directly to local providers. It can take a week or longer for allocation by the federal government to arrive at public health offices or providers for administration.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How can I sign-up to be a COVID-19 vaccine provider?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">See <a href="https://eziz.org/assets/other/IMM-1295.pdf">myCAvax Provider Enrollment</a> instructions for steps to sign up. Also read the CDPH’s COVID-19 vaccine provider <a class="external" href="https://eziz.org/covid/enrollment/">enrollment</a> and <a class="external" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/COVID-19VaccineTraining.aspx">training</a> requirements.</p>



<h3 id="Getting-vaccinated">Getting vaccinated</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How many COVID-19 vaccine doses are needed?</h4>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Two doses for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, 21 days apart</li><li>Two doses for the Moderna vaccine, 28 days apart</li><li>One dose for the Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen vaccine</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If two shots are required, <strong><strong>get your second shot as close to the recommended interval as possible</strong></strong>,<strong> </strong>but not sooner. However, if you can’t get it at the recommended interval, second doses may be given up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose. There is limited data on how well these vaccines work beyond this window. But if the second dose is given after 42 days, there is no need to start over.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Be sure to get the same vaccine the second time that you got the first time. COVID-19 vaccines are not interchangeable with each other. The safety and efficacy of mixing vaccines has not been tested.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How much will the COVID-19 vaccine cost?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Nothing. COVID-19 vaccines, including their administration, are free.</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. We do not know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I get vaccinated against COVID-19 while I am currently sick with COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. People with COVID-19 who have symptoms should wait to be vaccinated until they have recovered from their illness and have met the <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html">criteria</a> for ending isolation. Those without symptoms should also wait until they <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html">meet the criteria</a> before getting vaccinated. This guidance also applies to people who get COVID-19 before getting their second dose of vaccine.</p>



<h3 id="Vaccines-for-people-with-high-risk">Vaccines for people with high-risk medical conditions or disabilities</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How do people with these high-risk conditions or disabilities get a COVID-19 vaccine?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">There are five ways you can find an appointment. Vaccine supply remains limited nationwide.</p>



<ol class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Your healthcare provider: Check first with your usual health care provider to see if they have vaccines. Those who have vaccines may also begin reaching out to you to schedule your vaccine appointment.</li><li>Pharmacies: You can check your local pharmacies to see if they have vaccines and available appointments.&nbsp;</li><li>Your local health department: Your local health department’s website will have information about how to find available vaccine appointments, even as national supply remains limited.</li><li>Community pop-up clinics:<em> </em>These clinics for people with high-risk medical conditions and disabilities are targeted for equity to those living in communities with the lowest Healthy Places Index (HPI) scores. Community partners will reach out to people eligible for the pop-up clinics.</li><li>MyTurn: Throughout the spring you will be able to schedule an appointment through California’s MyTurn, in two ways:<ul><li>Online at <a href="http://www.myturn.ca.gov">myturn.ca.gov</a>. The MyTurn website is accessible to people with disabilities and in eight languages:<ul><li>English</li><li>Spanish</li><li>Simplified and traditional Chinese</li><li>Tagalog</li><li>Korean</li><li>Arabic</li><li>Vietnamese</li></ul></li><li>By calling the COVID-19 Hotline at 1-833-422-4255 or 1-833-4CA-4ALL (M-F 8AM-8PM, Sa-Su 8AM-5PM). The hotline is accessible to people with disabilities and offers services in English and Spanish.&nbsp; It also provides connections to interpretive services in more than 250 languages.</li></ul></li></ol>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You will be asked to state that you have a high-risk medical condition or disability, either to book an available appointment or to register for notice of future appointments made available as supply increases. You will be able to request an accommodation at your vaccine site through MyTurn. &nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will I need to verify I have a high-risk medical condition or disability when I go to my appointment?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">To protect confidentiality, verification of the diagnosis or type of disability is not required. Instead, anyone meeting the eligibility requirements will be asked to sign a self-attestation that they meet the criteria for high-risk medical conditions or disabilities.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will COVID-19 vaccine sites be accessible?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. All vaccine clinics in California are required to ensure sites and services are accessible in accordance with ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) requirements.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How do I get a COVID-19 vaccine at home, if I am unable to travel to a vaccine site?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Check with your healthcare provider, local health department, or local pharmacy.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How do I get transportation to a vaccine site?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Check with your healthcare provider, local health department, or local pharmacy.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you receive Medi-Cal through a managed care plan, contact your plan’s member service department to request assistance for transportation to receive covered benefits. If you receive Medi-Cal through Fee-for-Service (FFS), you can access a list of Non-Medical Transportation (NMT) providers in your county and you can contact them directly to arrange transportation to your appointments.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If there is not a provider in your area, the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) can assist if you email them DHCSNMT@dhcs.ca.gov. Please do NOT include personal information in your first email. DHCS staff will reply with a secure email asking for your information about the appointment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you have a need for Non-Emergency Medical Transportation, please inform your medical provider who can prescribe this service and put you in touch with a transportation provider to coordinate your ride to and from your appointment(s).</p>



<h3 id="What-to-expect-after-vaccination">What to expect after vaccination</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will the COVID-19 vaccine make me test positive for COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. A vaccine will not cause you to test positive on <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html">viral tests</a>.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If your body develops an immune response (the goal of vaccination), there is a possibility that you may test positive on <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html">antibody tests</a>. Antibody tests indicate that you may have protection against the virus.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How is my privacy protected if I take the COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">California law strictly limits how personal information about those who are vaccinated can be shared. California negotiated with the federal government to limit the required data sharing to only information that will not allow an individual to be identified.</p>
