<h2><strong>Vaccinations for kids 12-15</strong></h2>



<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">Are vaccines safe for our youth ages 12 to 15?</div>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine is <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use">authorized by the FDA</a> for those aged 12-15. It was found to be safe and effective in protecting children as young as 12 in clinical trials.</p>



<p>This broader authorization of this COVID-19 vaccine for younger people will help California build on our huge success vaccinating the majority of the population 16 and up. The COVID-19 vaccine is free for all Californians, regardless of insurance and immigration status. You will not be asked about your immigration status when you receive the vaccine.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator bd-top-darkblue" id="How-vaccines-work"/>



<h2>How vaccines work</h2>



<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">How do COVID-19 vaccines work?</div>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">COVID-19 vaccines teach our immune systems how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19. It typically takes a few weeks after vaccination for the body to build protection (immunity) against the virus. That means it is possible a person could still get COVID-19 just after vaccination, because the vaccine has not had enough time to build immunity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the vaccine you got requires two shots, be sure to get both doses so it can work fully.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="Vaccine-safety">Vaccine safety&nbsp;</h3>



<p>COVID-19 vaccines authorized by the FDA have been shown to be <a class="external" href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained">safe</a> and <a class="external" href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines">effective</a> in clinical trials. These vaccines were authorized only after it was found that they make it substantially less likely you’ll get COVID-19.</p>



<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">How effective are the COVID-19 vaccines?</div>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">The authorized vaccines are up to 95% effective against a person becoming ill with COVID-19.</p>



<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">Is the COVID-19 vaccine safe?</div>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">The U.S. vaccine safety system ensures that all vaccines are as safe as possible. Learn how the federal government is working to <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.html">ensure the safety of COVID-19 vaccines</a>.</p>



<h4>Safety monitoring after vaccination</h4>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">Millions of people in the United States have received COVID-19 vaccines. These vaccines have undergone the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history, using both <a class="external" href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/">established</a> and <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html">new safety monitoring systems</a>. These vaccines cannot give you COVID-19. Learn more <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/facts.html">facts about COVID-19 vaccines.</a></p>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer"><a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html">Results from monitoring efforts are reassuring</a>. Many people have reported only mild side effects after COVID-19 vaccination. Some people have no side effects.</p>



<h4>You cannot get COVID-19 from the vaccine</h4>



<p>The vaccines do not contain coronavirus and cannot give you COVID-19.</p>

<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">Why should I get a COVID-19 vaccine?</div>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">COVID-19 vaccines are effective at keeping you from getting COVID-19. But they have other benefits, too:</p>



<ul class="js-qa js-qa-answer"><li>In the rare case that you do still get COVID-19, the vaccine may help keep you from getting seriously ill.&nbsp;</li><li>Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you, <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/index.html">particularly people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19</a>.</li><li>COVID-19 vaccination is a safer way to help build immunity. COVID-19 can have <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">serious, life-threatening complications,</a> and there is no way to know how COVID-19 will affect you.</li></ul>

<h2>What to expect after vaccination</h2>



<h3 id="You-may-have-mild-side-effects">You may have mild side effects</h3>



<p>After COVID-19 vaccination, you may have some side effects. These are normal signs that your body is building immunity. Your arm may hurt where you got your shot or you may have redness or swelling. You may be tired or have a headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, or nausea. &nbsp;They may affect your ability to do daily activities, but should go away in a few days. Some people have no side effects. Learn more about <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html">Possible Side Effects After Getting a COVID-19 Vaccine</a>.</p>



<p>The CDC recommends women younger than 50 years old to be aware of the rare risk of blood clots with low platelets after taking Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Janssen (J&amp;J/Janssen) COVID-19 Vaccine, and that other COVID-19 vaccines are available where this risk has not been seen. Read CDPH’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/JnJ_factsheet.pdf">Fact Sheet: Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 Vaccine Benefits and Risks</a>.</p>



<p>If you have experienced a side effect after COVID-19 vaccination, you can report it to:</p>



<ul><li><a class="external" href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html">VAERS</a> (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System)</li><li><a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html">V-safe</a> (After Vaccination Health Checker)</li></ul>



<h4 class="When to call the doctor" id="When-to-call-the-doctor">When to call the doctor</h4>



<p>In most cases, discomfort from pain or fever is a normal sign that your body is building protection. Contact your doctor or healthcare provider:</p>



<ul><li>If the redness or tenderness where you got the shot gets worse after 24 hours</li><li>If your side effects are worrying you or do not seem to be going away after a few days</li></ul>



<p class="pb-5">If you get a COVID-19 vaccine and you think you might be having a severe allergic reaction after leaving the vaccination site, seek immediate medical care by calling 911.

<h2 class="pt-4" id="Vaccine-equity-for-hardest-hit-communities">Vaccine equity for hardest-hit communities</h2>



<p>California is allocating COVID-19 vaccines as they become available to ensure equitable distribution.</p>



<p>We must end the COVID-19 pandemic as quickly and effectively as possible by vaccinating those most at risk of serious outcomes and those who have been most exposed at work or in their daily lives. By targeting vaccines to those who most need them, we can also begin to <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/BlueprintForSaferEconomy.aspx">safely reopen activities</a> across our economy. This will protect not just those who are vaccinated, but reduce additional community transmission. It will also help reduce potential new variants that might emerge.</p>

<h2>Questions and answers</h2>



<h3 id="Vaccination-for-children">Vaccination for children</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>Do providers need parental consent before administering  a COVID-19 vaccine to a minor? </strong>   </h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Vaccine providers must obtain consent from a parent, legal guardian, or other adult having legal custody before vaccinating a minor. But there are some exceptions:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=FAM&amp;sectionNum=7050.">Emancipated minors</a> do not need the consent of a parent or guardian to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.</li><li>Providers may accept written consent from a parent or legal guardian of an unaccompanied minor.&nbsp;The written consent must verify the parent/guardian has been provided the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download">Pfizer EUA Fact Sheet</a>.</li><li>Phone or video consent is possible if the parent/guardian confirms that they have been provided the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download">Pfizer EUA Fact Sheet</a> or the Fact Sheet is read to the parent/guardian.</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Families should check with their vaccine provider on acceptable forms of consent. See CDPH’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Pfizer-Vaccine-Minor-Consent-Guidance.aspx">Pfizer Vaccine Minor Consent Guidance</a> for more details.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Why should I vaccinate my child?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Cases in children are increasing. The <a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/AAP%20and%20CHA%20-%20Children%20and%20COVID-19%20State%20Data%20Report%204.29.21%20FINAL.pdf">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> reports that youth now account for 22% of new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. This time last year it was only around 3%. It is important to get young people vaccinated to prevent new cases from increasing further.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The more vaccinations, the more we stop the spread of highly contagious coronavirus variants and shrink the pool of people vulnerable to COVID-19. By getting our 12- to 15-year-olds vaccinated, families can be safer as we get back to doing the things we love.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">My child has had reactions to other vaccines – should they still get the vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, unless they have had anaphylactic type reactions to components of the Pfizer vaccine.<strong> </strong>Allergic reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine are rare and very few people have had severe adverse reactions. If your child has allergic reactions to the flu vaccine or other severe allergies, you should report that to their health providers in advance of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The COVID-19 vaccine is safe, effective, and important to receive in order to overcome this pandemic. <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Is there an increased vaccination risk to children who have pre-existing conditions like asthma?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Youth aged 12 to 15 can still receive the COVID-19 vaccine even if they have underlying health conditions. If you have specific questions about a condition, please talk to your healthcare provider, local community clinic, or public health office.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will my child be required to get vaccinated before returning to in-person schooling, especially in the fall?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">While vaccination isn’t currently required to return to in-person learning, the state’s objective is to get as many of our 2.1 million 12 to 15-year-olds vaccinated prior to the new fall term. By getting our young people vaccinated soon, we can take comfort in knowing those over age 12 are protected against highly contagious coronavirus variants and COVID-19, both inside and outside of the classroom.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will my child be required to get vaccinated before they can play recreational or school sports? What about returning to the band or theater or rejoining clubs?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">While vaccination isn’t currently required to play sports, this is the time for our youth to join their teammates and friends in getting vaccinated so they can protect themselves and each other against COVID-19. The state’s industry guidance provides guidelines to support a safe environment for <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#youthsports-guidance">youth sports activities</a>.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The resumption of other group activities such as band, theater, and clubs will be coordinated by schools in concert with future state guidelines. Meanwhile, getting our young people vaccinated when they are eligible can help them return to the things they love sooner.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Why is the vaccine only for adolescents 12 and over? When do you expect vaccines to be available for younger children?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Vaccine trials and approvals commonly begin with older, more vulnerable populations then extend to younger ages. Adolescents were the next group to be prioritized because they are most similar to adults and are more likely than younger kids to spread the virus and become seriously ill. This approach balances the need for safety and speed, while protecting our children throughout vaccine development.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Both Pfizer and Moderna have ongoing clinical trials in people younger than 12. Depending on the outcome of those trials, authorization for this next age group could happen later this year. Johnson &amp; Johnson is currently in clinical trials for the 12-17 age group.</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">The <a href="https://saferatwork.covid19.ca.gov/employer-vaccination-toolkit/">Employer Vaccination Toolkit</a> provides all the information you need to:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Partner with local providers for offsite vaccination events</li><li>Request a worksite mobile clinic</li><li>Help employees find and book vaccination appointments</li><li>Share and promote resources that support employees in getting vaccinated</li></ul>



<h3 id="Getting-vaccinated">Getting vaccinated</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How many COVID-19 vaccine doses are needed?</h4>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Two doses for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, 21 days apart</li><li>Two doses for the Moderna vaccine, 28 days apart</li><li>One dose for the Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen vaccine</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If two shots are required, <strong><strong>get your second shot as close to the recommended interval as possible</strong></strong>,<strong> </strong>but not sooner. However, if you can’t get it at the recommended interval, second doses may be given up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose. There is limited data on how well these vaccines work beyond this window. But if the second dose is given after 42 days, there is no need to start over.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Be sure to get the same vaccine the second time that you got the first time. COVID-19 vaccines are not interchangeable with each other. The safety and efficacy of mixing vaccines has not been tested.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How much will the COVID-19 vaccine cost?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Nothing. COVID-19 vaccines, including their administration, are free to the public.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">What does it mean to be “fully vaccinated”?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">People are considered fully vaccinated for COVID-19 two weeks after they receive the second dose in a 2-dose series (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna), or two weeks after they have received a single-dose vaccine (Johnson and Johnson/Janssen).</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">See CDPH’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID-19-Public-Health-Recommendations-for-Fully-Vaccinated-People.aspx">COVID-19 Public Health Recommendations for Fully Vaccinated People</a> for complete details.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will the COVID-19 vaccine make me test positive for COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. A vaccine will not cause you to test positive on <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html">viral tests</a>.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If your body develops an immune response (the goal of vaccination), there is a possibility that you may test positive on <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html">antibody tests</a>. Antibody tests indicate that you may have protection against the virus.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How is my privacy protected if I take the COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">California law strictly limits how personal information about those who are vaccinated can be shared. California negotiated with the federal government to limit the required data sharing to only information that will not allow an individual to be identified.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Read more at CDPH’s <a class="external" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/California-Data-Use-Agreement.aspx">California Data Use Agreement and Frequently Asked Questions</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Should I keep my COVID-19 vaccination record card?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. We urge Californians to keep their vaccination record cards for themselves and their families in a safe place to prevent loss or damage. Individuals who need replacement cards should contact their vaccination provider for replacement.&nbsp;You can request your <a href="https://cairforms.cairweb.org/AuthorizationToRelease/AuthorizationToRelease">COVID-19 vaccination record</a> from the California Immunization Registry (CAIR). However, CAIR does not provide replacement cards.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">If I&#8217;m pregnant or breastfeeding, should I get the COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a> states that pregnant and lactating individuals can receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Experts have not identified any safety concerns for pregnant or lactating people who were vaccinated or their breastfeeding babies. The COVID-19 vaccines do not contain the live virus, so they cannot cause COVID-19.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Pregnant people are more likely to get severely ill with COVID-19 compared with non-pregnant people. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy can protect you from severe illness if you get COVID-19. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have questions about getting a COVID-19 vaccine.&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>If you tested positive, had only mild symptoms, and were not treated for the coronavirus, you should wait at least 10 days since the start of COVID-19 symptoms <strong>and </strong>satisfy<strong> </strong><a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html">criteria</a> to discontinue isolation before getting the COVID-19 vaccine.</li><li>Wait 90 days to get the vaccine if you recovered from a COVID-19 infection and were treated with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma.</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I get a COVID-19 vaccine at the same time as another vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, you can get a COVID-19 vaccine and other vaccines at the same visit. You no longer need to wait 14 days between different vaccinations. Experience has shown that the way our bodies develop protection after getting vaccinated (immune response) and the level of&nbsp;side effects are generally the same when given alone or with other vaccines.

<h3 id="Vaccine-choices">Vaccine choices</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will I have a choice between the various COVID-19 vaccines?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It depends on vaccine availability. Check with your health care provider to find out which vaccines they have available. The <a href="https://vaccinefinder.org/search/">VaccineFinder</a> allows you the option to search for vaccines by manufacturer.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Are the COVID-19 vaccines mandatory?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No, there is no mandatory vaccination requirement from either the state or federal government.&nbsp;Once more and more Californians see how safe and effective the COVID-19 vaccines are, we hope they will voluntarily opt to receive them.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">May an employer require COVID-19 vaccination for all employees entering the workplace?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, if certain requirements are met. Under the ADA, an employer may require all employees to meet a qualification standard that is job-related and consistent with business necessity, such as a safety-related standard requiring COVID-19 vaccination. However, if a particular employee cannot meet such a safety-related qualification standard because of a disability, the employer may not require compliance for that employee unless they can demonstrate that the individual would pose a “direct threat” to the health or safety of the employee or others in the workplace.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
