<p class="emphasized">COVID-19 vaccination is one of the most important tools to end the COVID-19 pandemic. The State is prioritizing vaccines for equitable distribution to everyone in California who wants it. We expect to have enough supplies to vaccinate most Californians by summer 2021.</p>

<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued <a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines">Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) for two COVID-19 vaccines</a>. More vaccines may be authorized early this year.</p>

<h2 id="Vaccine-safety">Vaccine safety&nbsp;</h2>



<p>COVID-19 vaccines authorized by the FDA have been shown to be <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained">safe</a> and <a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines">effective</a> in clinical trials.</p>



<p>The first two vaccines are up to 95% effectiveness against a person becoming ill with COVID-19.</p>



<p>The U.S. vaccine safety system ensures that all vaccines are as safe as possible. Learn how the federal government is working to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.html">ensure the safety of COVID-19 vaccines</a>.</p>



<h3 id="How-vaccines--work">How vaccines&nbsp;work</h3>



<p>Vaccines help our immune system fight infections in the future. COVID-19 vaccines will protect us from the virus that causes COVID-19 without having to get the illness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It typically takes a few weeks after the last dose in a series to become fully protected. On the days after taking the vaccine, you may have a sore arm, aches, fatigue or fever, but these are not harmful. These symptoms signal that your immune system is developing protection from the virus.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="Benefits-of-getting-vaccinated">Benefits of getting vaccinated</h3>



<p>COVID-19 vaccines are meant to prevent you from getting COVID-19 and from spreading it to others. The ability of COVID-19 vaccines to protect us from spreading the virus to others is not yet known, but is being studied carefully.</p>

<h2 id="California's-vaccination-plan">California&#8217;s vaccination plan</h2>



<p>California is allocating COVID-19 vaccines as they become available to ensure equitable distribution. Initially vaccination was limited to healthcare workers and long-term care residents.</p>



<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">When can the general public, who are not in Phase 1, start getting vaccinated?</div>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">Vaccinations are prioritized according to age and risk. A portion of the California population can get vaccinated now, and the rest should have access by spring 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">Every Californian can <a href="https://myturn.ca.gov">sign up</a> or call (833) 422-4255 to see if it&#8217;s their turn to get the COVID-19 vaccine. If you’re not currently eligible, you can sign up to be notified when it’s your turn.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/VaccineAllocationGuidelines.aspx">CDPH Updated Vaccine Allocation Guidelines for COVID-19 Vaccine</a> for details.</p>



<h3>How vaccine decisions are made</h3>



<p>A group of experts and a group of community representatives work together to make sure vaccines are prioritized fairly.</p>



<h4>Drafting Guidelines Workgroup</h4>



<p>A Drafting Guidelines Workgroup is developing California-specific guidance for the prioritization and allocation of vaccines.</p>



<p>See CDPH’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Drafting-Guidelines-Workgroup.aspx/">Workgroup page</a> for the vaccine&#8217;s phasing and resource materials.</p>



<h4>Community Vaccine Advisory Committee</h4>



<p>The Community Vaccine Advisory Committee is providing input and feedback to the planning efforts and resolving barriers to equitable vaccine implementation and decision-making.</p>



<p>See CDPH’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Community-Vaccine-Advisory-Committee.aspx/">committee activities page</a> for the upcoming meeting schedule and all meeting materials.</p>



<h3 id="Vaccine-allocation-and-administration">Vaccine allocation and administration</h3>



<p>Once a week, the federal government announces anticipated allocation figures for each state. The number of allocated doses provided by the federal government is a projection and subject to change. Local providers are required to place their orders which are reviewed by the state and submitted to the federal government. The federal government then authorizes the order and submits the request to the manufacturer. The manufacturer or central distributor ships the vaccine directly to local providers. It can take a week or longer for allocation by the federal government to arrive at public health offices or providers for administration.</p>



<h2 id="California-vaccines-dashboard">Vaccination progress dashboard</h2>



<p>This dashboard makes vaccine data transparent and accessible to all Californians. This dashboard is updated daily.</p>



<p>The map reports vaccines administered by the county of residence. Where county of residence was not reported in a vaccination record, the county of provider that vaccinated the resident is included. This applies to less than 1% of vaccination records. The sum of county-level vaccinations does not equal statewide total vaccinations due to out-of-state residents vaccinated in California.</p>

<h2 id="What-to-expect-after-vaccination">What to expect after vaccination</h2>



<p>How much protection COVID-19 vaccination provides under real-life conditions is still unknown. Even with a vaccine, you may still be able to spread COVID-19. It is important for everyone to continue using all the tools available to us to help stop this pandemic, like:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html"><strong>Staying home and isolating</strong></a><strong> from others when sick</strong></li><li>Wearing masks&nbsp;</li><li>Washing hands often</li><li>Social distancing and avoiding crowds&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Together, COVID-19 vaccination and taking <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html">steps to protect yourself and others</a></a> will offer the best protection from getting and spreading COVID-19. We need to understand more about the protection that vaccines provide before we change recommendations on mask use.</p>



<h3>You cannot get COVID-19 from the vaccine</h3>



<p>COVID-19 vaccines do not contain coronavirus and cannot give you COVID-19. Be sure to get both doses of the vaccine so it can work fully.</p>



<h3>Testing for COVID-19 during the rollout of vaccines</h3>



<p>It will take many months before enough people are fully vaccinated to stop the spread of COVID-19. Therefore, at this time, <strong>CDPH does not recommend changes to testing requirements for individuals, even those who have been fully vaccinated.</strong> As the science and evidence evolves, CDPH will issue updated guidance to reflect new information and data.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Get tested:</strong> If you have symptoms or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, you should get tested. This is true even after being vaccinated. <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/get-tested/"><strong>Tests for COVID-19</strong></a><strong> work the same in vaccinated people as they do in unvaccinated people.</strong></li><li><strong>Testing keeps you, your family, and friends safe</strong><ul><li>There are usually no out-of-pocket costs to <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/Nearby/index.html?appid=43118dc0d5d348d8ab20a81967a15401">get tested</a> at state testing sites.</li><li>Test results are usually returned in no more than two days.</li><li>See <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/get-tested/">testing page</a> or call <a href="Tel: 833-422-4255">(833) 422-4255 </a>to find a test site near you</li><li>Discuss your symptoms with your healthcare provider</li></ul></li><li>If your job requires it, you still need to get tested regularly, even if you had the vaccine</li></ul>

<h2 class="mt-5" id="Questions-and-answers">Questions and answers</h2>



<h3 class="h2 mt-5">Vaccination planning </h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How can I get the COVID-19 vaccination?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Most Californians will be vaccinated at:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Community vaccination sites</li><li>Doctor&#8217;s offices</li><li>Clinics</li><li>Pharmacies&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Healthcare workers and individuals 65+ near San Francisco, Los Angeles, or San Diego Counties can book appointments immediately through the <a href="https://myturn.ca.gov">myturn.ca.gov</a> site or by calling (833) 422-4255. Online appointment scheduling for other groups and residents of other counties will be available soon. Appointments are also available in Spanish through the <a href="https://myturn.ca.gov">myturn.ca.gov</a> site or by calling (833) 422-4255.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Some <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/get-local-information/">local health jurisdictions</a> are also providing appointments, registration, and notification services.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Every Californian can sign up at <a href="https://myturn.ca.gov">myturn.ca.gov</a> or call (833) 422-4255 to see if it&#8217;s their turn to get the COVID-19 vaccine. If you’re not currently eligible, you can sign up to be notified when it’s your turn.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How can I sign-up to be a COVID-19 vaccine provider?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">CDPH is in the process of developing <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/COVIDVaccineEnrollment.aspx#">Enrollment Resources</a>.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Initial enrollment in the vaccination program is limited to sites selected by local health departments. All other interested providers (including clinics and pharmacies) will be welcome to enroll early this year.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="h2 mt-5">Getting vaccinated</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How many COVID-19 vaccine doses are needed?</h4>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Two doses for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, 21 days apart</li><li>Two doses for the Moderna vaccine, 28 days apart</li></ul>



<p><strong>Get your second shot as close to the recommended interval as possible.</strong> However, if you can’t get it within that time, second doses may be given up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose. There is limited data on how well these vaccines work beyond this window. But if the second dose is given after 42 days, there is no need to start over.</p>



<p>Be sure to get the same COVID-19 vaccine the second time that you got the first time. These vaccines are not interchangeable with each other or with other COVID-19 vaccines. The safety and efficacy of mixing vaccines has not been tested.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How much will the COVID-19 vaccine cost?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Nothing. COVID-19 vaccines, including their administration, are free.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Read more at the Department of Managed Health Care’s <a href="https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/Portals/0/Docs/DO/VaccineFactSheetAccessible.pdf">Know Your Health Care Rights</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Do I need to be a California resident to get COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. Vaccine distribution is based on eligibility irrespective of residency or immigration status.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I register somewhere to get the COVID-19 vaccine? How will I be notified when it’s my turn to get it?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Every Californian can sign up at <a href="https://myturn.ca.gov">myturn.ca.gov</a> or call (833) 422-4255 to see if it&#8217;s their turn to get the COVID-19 vaccine. If you’re not currently eligible, you can sign up to be notified when it’s your turn.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Healthcare workers and individuals 65+ in San Francisco, Los Angeles,&nbsp; and San Diego Counties can book appointments immediately through the <a href="https://myturn.ca.gov">myturn.ca.gov</a> site or by calling (833) 422-4255.

<h4 class="wp-accordion">I’ve already had COVID-19. Should I get a COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. At this time, we do not know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19.</p>



<h3 class="h2 mt-5">What to expect after vaccination</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will the COVID-19 vaccine make me test positive for COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. A vaccine will not cause you to test positive on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html">viral tests</a>.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If your body develops an immune response (the goal of vaccination), there is a possibility that you may test positive on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html">antibody tests</a>. Antibody tests indicate that you may have protection against the virus.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How is my privacy protected if I take the COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">California law strictly limits how personal information about those who are vaccinated can be shared. California negotiated with the federal government to limit the required data sharing to only information that will not allow an individual to be identified.</p>

<h3 class="h2 mt-5">Vaccine limitations</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">I have allergies. Should I get the COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It depends. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html">CDC recommends</a> that:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>If you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient in a COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get that specific vaccine.</li><li>If you have a severe allergic reaction after getting the first shot, you should not get the second shot.</li><li>If you have had an immediate allergic reaction—even if it was not severe—to any ingredient in an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get either of the currently available mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.</li><li>If you had an immediate allergic reaction after getting the first dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get the second dose.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>People who are allergic to polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polysorbate should not get an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.</li><li>If you have had a severe allergic reaction to other vaccines or injections, you should ask your doctor if you should get a COVID-19 vaccine.</li><li>People with a history of severe allergic reactions not related to vaccines or injections may still get vaccinated.

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Pregnant women have a higher risk for complications from COVID-19 disease. There are no study results available yet on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant women. However, experts believe that the vaccines are unlikely to pose a risk to the woman or the fetus. Pregnant women can talk with a doctor about their risk of COVID-19 disease and how they might benefit from vaccination.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I get a COVID-19 vaccine at the same time as another vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html#">CDC recommends</a>:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Wait at least 14 days before getting any other vaccine, including a flu or shingles vaccine, if you get your COVID-19 vaccine first. And if you get another vaccine first, wait at least 14 days before getting your COVID-19 vaccine.</li><li>If a COVID-19 vaccine is inadvertently given within 14 days of another vaccine, you do not need to restart the COVID-19 vaccine series; you should still complete the series on schedule. When more data are available on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines administered simultaneously with other vaccines, the CDC may update this recommendation.</li></ul>
