<h2>What&#8217;s new with vaccines</h2>



<p>Most Californians can get vaccinated for free. Check with your health provider to see if your vaccination is free.

<h2>How COVID-19 vaccines work</h2>

   <p class="caption">Vaccines are highly effective at preventing severe illness from COVID-19. They can help you avoid hospitalization and death.</p>
    </div>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">COVID-19 vaccines teach our immune systems how to fight the virus that causes COVID-19. You can still get COVID-19 after vaccination, but your symptoms are likely to be much less severe. Vaccination helps you avoid hospitalization and death.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>What we know</h3>



<ul><li>Vaccinations can prevent most COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths.</li><li>Updated COVID-19 vaccines will address many <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID-Variants.aspx" target="_blank">variants</a> of the virus.</li><li>People with weak immune systems are more likely to experience severe COVID-19 symptoms, even if vaccinated.</li><li>The vaccine can still help you even if you have had COVID-19.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" id="Variants"/>



<h2>Vaccines and variants</h2>



<p>Vaccination has proven very effective against COVID-19 variants.&nbsp;The best thing we can do to protect ourselves from getting very sick from COVID-19 is to stay up-to-date with vaccines. </p>



<p>As of September 12, 2023, CDC recommends everyone 6 months and older get an updated COVID-19 vaccine to protect against the potentially serious outcomes of COVID-19 illness this fall and winter. What you need to know:</p>



<ul><li>Any Californian aged 6 months and older can get vaccinated. </li><li>Most people 5 years or older should get one dose of the updated vaccine.</li><li>Children under 5 years and people with weakened immune systems may be eligible to receive multiple doses of the updated vaccine. </li><li>The updated vaccine is designed to address the variants of COVID-19. As new variants keep emerging, the updated vaccine is an <strong>important tool to protect us</strong> from the circulating strains. See <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID-Variants.aspx">variants now present in California</a></li></ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" id="Booster-shots-and-additional-doses"/>



<h2 id="Digitalvaccinerecored">Digital vaccine record</h2>



<p>You can now get a digital copy of your vaccination record. This is called the <a href="https://myvaccinerecord.cdph.ca.gov/">Digital Vaccine Record</a> (DVR). It’s available to you if:</p>



<ul><li>You got vaccinated in California, and</li><li>Your information matches what is recorded in the state’s immunization systems.</li></ul>

<h2>Side effects</h2>



<p>After COVID-19 vaccination, you may have some mild side effects. These are normal signs that your body is building immunity. More serious side effects rarely happen.</p>



<h3>Mild side effects</h3>



<p>Common mild side effects include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Soreness, redness, or swelling where you got the vaccination</li><li>Feeling tired, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, or nausea</li></ul>



<p>Side effects may affect your ability to do daily activities, but should go away in a few days. Some people have no side effects.</p>



<h3>Reporting side effects of vaccines</h3>



<p>If you have experienced a side effect after COVID-19 vaccination, you can report it to:</p>



<ul><li><a class="external" href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html">VAERS</a> (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System)</li></ul>



<h3 class="When to call the doctor" id="When-to-call-the-doctor">When to call the doctor</h3>



<p>In most cases, discomfort from pain or fever is a normal sign that your body is building protection. Contact your doctor or healthcare provider:</p>



<ul><li>If the redness or tenderness where you received the vaccine gets worse after 24 hours</li><li>If your side effects are worrying you or do not seem to be going away after a few days</li></ul>
