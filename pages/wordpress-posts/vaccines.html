<h2><strong>Vaccinations for kids 12-15</strong></h2>



<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">Are vaccines safe for our youth ages 12 to 15?</div>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine is <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use">authorized by the FDA</a> for those aged 12-15. It was found to be safe and effective in protecting children as young as 12 in clinical trials.</p>



<p>This broader authorization of this COVID-19 vaccine for younger people will help California build on our huge success vaccinating the majority of the population 16 and up. The COVID-19 vaccine is free for all Californians, regardless of insurance and immigration status. You will not be asked about your immigration status when you receive the vaccine.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator bd-top-darkblue" id="How-vaccines-work"/>



<h2>How vaccines work</h2>



<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">How do COVID-19 vaccines work?</div>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">COVID-19 vaccines teach our immune systems how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19. It typically takes a few weeks after vaccination for the body to build protection (immunity) against the virus. That means it is possible a person could still get COVID-19 just after vaccination, because the vaccine has not had enough time to build immunity.&nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator bd-top-darkblue" id="What-to-expect-after-vaccination"/>



<h2>What to expect after vaccination</h2>



<h3 id="You-may-have-mild-side-effects">You may have mild side effects</h3>



<p>After COVID-19 vaccination, you may have some side effects. These are normal signs that your body is building immunity. Your arm may hurt where you got your shot or you may have redness or swelling. You may be tired or have a headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, or nausea. &nbsp;They may affect your ability to do daily activities, but should go away in a few days. Some people have no side effects. Learn more about <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html">Possible Side Effects After Getting a COVID-19 Vaccine</a>.</p>



<p>The CDC recommends women younger than 50 years old to be aware of the rare risk of blood clots with low platelets after taking Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Janssen (J&amp;J/Janssen) COVID-19 Vaccine, and that other COVID-19 vaccines are available where this risk has not been seen. Read CDPH’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/JnJ_factsheet.pdf">Fact Sheet: Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 Vaccine Benefits and Risks</a>.</p>



<p>If you have experienced a side effect after COVID-19 vaccination, you can report it to:</p>



<ul><li><a class="external" href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html">VAERS</a> (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System)</li><li><a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html">V-safe</a> (After Vaccination Health Checker)</li></ul>



<h4 class="When to call the doctor" id="When-to-call-the-doctor">When to call the doctor</h4>



<p>In most cases, discomfort from pain or fever is a normal sign that your body is building protection. Contact your doctor or healthcare provider:</p>



<ul><li>If the redness or tenderness where you got the shot gets worse after 24 hours</li><li>If your side effects are worrying you or do not seem to be going away after a few days</li></ul>



<p>If you get a COVID-19 vaccine and you think you might be having a severe allergic reaction after leaving the vaccination site, seek immediate medical care by calling 911. Learn more about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html">COVID-19 vaccines and rare severe allergic reactions</a>.</p>



<h3>What you can start to do</h3>



<p>If you’ve been fully vaccinated, <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safe-reopening/">you can resume most activities that you did prior to the pandemic</a>. </p>

<h2>Questions and answers</h2>



<h3 id="Vaccination-for-children">Vaccination for children</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>Do providers need parental consent before administering&nbsp; a COVID-19 vaccine to a minor?&nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Vaccine providers must obtain consent from a parent, legal guardian, or other adult having legal custody before vaccinating a minor. But there are some exceptions:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=FAM&amp;sectionNum=7050.">Emancipated minors</a> do not need the consent of a parent or guardian to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.</li><li>Providers may accept written consent from a parent or legal guardian of an unaccompanied minor.&nbsp;The written consent must verify the parent/guardian has been provided the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download">Pfizer EUA Fact Sheet</a>.</li><li>Phone or video consent is possible if the parent/guardian confirms that they have been provided the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download">Pfizer EUA Fact Sheet</a> or the Fact Sheet is read to the parent/guardian.</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Families should check with their vaccine provider on acceptable forms of consent. See CDPH’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Pfizer-Vaccine-Minor-Consent-Guidance.aspx">Pfizer Vaccine Minor Consent Guidance</a> for more details.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Why should I vaccinate my child?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Cases in children are increasing. The <a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/AAP%20and%20CHA%20-%20Children%20and%20COVID-19%20State%20Data%20Report%204.29.21%20FINAL.pdf">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> reports that youth now account for 22% of new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. This time last year it was only around 3%. It is important to get young people vaccinated to prevent new cases from increasing further.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The more vaccinations, the more we stop the spread of highly contagious coronavirus variants and shrink the pool of people vulnerable to COVID-19. By getting our 12- to 15-year-olds vaccinated, families can be safer as we get back to doing the things we love.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">My child has had reactions to other vaccines – should they still get the vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, unless they have had anaphylactic type reactions to components of the Pfizer vaccine.<strong> </strong>Allergic reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine are rare and very few people have had severe adverse reactions. If your child has allergic reactions to the flu vaccine or other severe allergies, you should report that to their health providers in advance of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The COVID-19 vaccine is safe, effective, and important to receive in order to overcome this pandemic. <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Is there an increased vaccination risk to children who have pre-existing conditions like asthma?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Youth aged 12 to 15 can still receive the COVID-19 vaccine even if they have underlying health conditions. If you have specific questions about a condition, please talk to your healthcare provider, local community clinic, or public health office.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will my child be required to get vaccinated before returning to in-person schooling, especially in the fall?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">While vaccination isn’t currently required to return to in-person learning, the state’s objective is to get as many of our 2.1 million 12 to 15-year-olds vaccinated prior to the new fall term. By getting our young people vaccinated soon, we can take comfort in knowing those over age 12 are protected against highly contagious coronavirus variants and COVID-19, both inside and outside of the classroom.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will my child be required to get vaccinated before they can play recreational or school sports? What about returning to the band or theater or rejoining clubs?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">While vaccination isn’t currently required to play sports, this is the time for our youth to join their teammates and friends in getting vaccinated so they can protect themselves and each other against COVID-19. The state’s industry guidance provides guidelines to support a safe environment for <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#youthsports-guidance">youth sports activities</a>.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The resumption of other group activities such as band, theater, and clubs will be coordinated by schools in concert with future state guidelines. Meanwhile, getting our young people vaccinated when they are eligible can help them return to the things they love sooner.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Why is the vaccine only for adolescents 12 and over? When do you expect vaccines to be available for younger children?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Vaccine trials and approvals commonly begin with older, more vulnerable populations then extend to younger ages. Adolescents were the next group to be prioritized because they are most similar to adults and are more likely than younger kids to spread the virus and become seriously ill. This approach balances the need for safety and speed, while protecting our children throughout vaccine development.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Both Pfizer and Moderna have ongoing clinical trials in people younger than 12. Depending on the outcome of those trials, authorization for this next age group could happen later this year. Johnson &amp; Johnson is currently in clinical trials for the 12-17 age group.</p>



<h3 id="Vaccines-allocation-and-distribution">Vaccines allocation and distribution</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">I&#8217;m an employer and want to help my employees get vaccinated. How do I do that?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The <a href="https://saferatwork.covid19.ca.gov/employer-vaccination-toolkit/">Employer Vaccination Toolkit</a> provides all the information you need to:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Partner with local providers for offsite vaccination events</li><li>Request a worksite mobile clinic</li><li>Help employees find and book vaccination appointments</li><li>Share and promote resources that support employees in getting vaccinated</li></ul>



<h3 id="Getting-vaccinated">Getting vaccinated</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>How many COVID-19 vaccine doses are needed? Can I get my second vaccine shot at a different interval than recommended? Can I mix and match COVID-19 vaccines from different manufacturers?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Ideally, you’d get:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Two doses for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, 21 days apart</li><li>Two doses for the Moderna vaccine, 28 days apart&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen vaccine only requires one dose.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If two shots are required, <strong><strong>get your second shot as close to the recommended interval as possible</strong></strong>,<strong> </strong>but not sooner. However, if you can’t get it at the recommended interval, second doses may be given up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose. There is limited data on how well these vaccines work beyond this window. But if the second dose is given after 42 days, there is no need to start over.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You can’t mix and match different vaccines. Be sure to get the same vaccine the second time that you got the first time. COVID-19 vaccines are not interchangeable with each other. The safety and efficacy of mixing vaccines has not been tested.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How much will the COVID-19 vaccine cost?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Nothing. COVID-19 vaccines, including their administration, are free to the public.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Read more at the Department of Managed Health Care’s <a class="external" href="https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/Portals/0/Docs/DO/VaccineFactSheetAccessible.pdf">Know Your Health Care Rights</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Do I need to be a California resident to get COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. Vaccine distribution is based on eligibility irrespective of residency or immigration status.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How do I cancel or reschedule my vaccine appointment through My Turn?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you need to cancel or reschedule your appointment, you can do so on your phone or computer, using the SMS or email appointment confirmation notification you received after booking.<br><br>On your phone, click the &#8220;QR Code link&#8221; in your SMS appointment confirmation. This will take you to a web page that contains your QR code and a link to the &#8220;<a href="https://myturn.ca.gov/manage">Manage your appointments</a>&#8221; page.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">On your computer, click the &#8220;Manage your appointment(s) here&#8221; link in the email appointment confirmation you received from My Turn. The &#8220;<a href="https://myturn.ca.gov/manage">Manage your appointments</a>&#8221; page will open and you will be asked to confirm your appointment with your appointment confirmation number and either your cell phone number or your email address.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">After confirming, you will have the choice to cancel or reschedule your appointment(s). If you choose to reschedule both your first and second dose Moderna or Pfizer appointment(s), or your single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson appointment, you will have the choice to change the clinic, appointment time, and/or appointment date. If you want to reschedule your second dose only without changing your first dose, you will only be able to change the second dose appointment time.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Once you have made your changes and click &#8220;Continue,&#8221; you will receive a new confirmation email and or text message. Your original appointment will not be changed unless you click &#8220;Continue.&#8221;</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">I’ve already had COVID-19. Should I get a COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. We do not know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I get vaccinated against COVID-19 while I am currently sick with COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. People with COVID-19 who have symptoms should wait to be vaccinated until they have recovered from their illness and have met the <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html">criteria</a> for ending isolation. Those without symptoms should also wait until they <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html">meet the criteria</a> before getting vaccinated. This guidance also applies to people who get COVID-19 before getting their second dose of vaccine.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will COVID-19 vaccine sites be accessible?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. All vaccine clinics in California are required to ensure sites and services are accessible in accordance with ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) requirements.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How do I get a COVID-19 vaccine at home, if I am unable to travel to a vaccine site?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Check with your healthcare provider, local health department, or local pharmacy.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you cannot leave your home to get vaccinated, you can indicate this on <a href="http://cert1.mail-west.com/rUyeH/mc7rm/myuzjan/rUgt/dk9o81/erho/nv6ok/51rUaxx">myturn.ca.gov</a> or when calling the state’s COVID-19 hotline at <a href="Tel: 833‑422‑4255">(833) 422‑4255</a>. If eligible, you will be connected with your local health jurisdiction to arrange for in-home vaccination services.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How do I get transportation to a vaccine site?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you do not have a way to get to a vaccination site, you can receive free transportation through <a href="http://cert1.mail-west.com/c7rmfWysJ/myuzjanm/fWgt/dk9o81/erho/nv6ok/61fWpjj">myturn.ca.gov</a> or by calling the state’s COVID-19 hotline at <a href="Tel: 833-422-4255">(833) 422-4255</a>.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Transportation options include automobile transportation for ambulatory patients and non-emergency medical transportation for non-ambulatory patients, including wheelchair vans, gurney transportation, and other options. Medi-Cal managed care and fee-for-service beneficiaries will be connected with their health plan or service provider to get transportation through existing health benefits.</p>

<h3 id="What-to-expect-after-vaccination-QA">What to expect after vaccination</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What is acceptable as proof of full vaccination?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The following are accepted:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Vaccination card, which includes name of person vaccinated, type of vaccine provided, and date last dose administered&nbsp;</li><li>A photo of a vaccination card as a separate document</li><li>A photo of the attendee’s vaccination card stored on their phone</li><li>Documentation of vaccination from a healthcare provider</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What does it mean to be “fully vaccinated”?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">People are considered fully vaccinated for COVID-19 two weeks after they receive the second dose in a 2-dose series (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna), or two weeks after they have received a single-dose vaccine (Johnson and Johnson/Janssen).</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">See CDPH’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID-19-Public-Health-Recommendations-for-Fully-Vaccinated-People.aspx">COVID-19 Public Health Recommendations for Fully Vaccinated People</a> for complete details.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will the COVID-19 vaccine make me test positive for COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. A vaccine will not cause you to test positive on <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html">viral tests</a>.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If your body develops an immune response (the goal of vaccination), there is a possibility that you may test positive on <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html">antibody tests</a>. Antibody tests indicate that you may have protection against the virus.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How is my privacy protected if I take the COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">California law strictly limits how personal information about those who are vaccinated can be shared. California negotiated with the federal government to limit the required data sharing to only information that will not allow an individual to be identified.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Read more at CDPH’s <a class="external" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/California-Data-Use-Agreement.aspx">California Data Use Agreement and Frequently Asked Questions</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Should I keep my COVID-19 vaccination record card?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. We urge Californians to keep their vaccination record cards for themselves and their families in a safe place to prevent loss or damage. Individuals who need replacement cards should contact their vaccination provider for replacement.&nbsp;You can request your <a href="https://cairforms.cairweb.org/AuthorizationToRelease/AuthorizationToRelease">COVID-19 vaccination record</a> from the California Immunization Registry (CAIR). However, CAIR does not provide replacement cards.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">If I get a COVID-19 vaccine, will I still need a flu shot this fall?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. COVID-19 vaccine does not provide protection against flu.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Are there certain populations who should not get a COVID-19 vaccine? <strong>What about people with allergies?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html">CDC recommends</a> that:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>If you have had a severe allergic reaction or an immediate allergic reaction—even if it was not severe—to any ingredient in an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get either of the currently available mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna).</li><li>If you have had a severe allergic reaction or an immediate allergic reaction to any ingredient in Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get the J&amp;J/Janssen vaccine.</li><li>If you had an immediate allergic reaction after getting the first dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get the second dose.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>If you are allergic to PEG, you should not get an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Ask your doctor if you can get the Janssen vaccine.</li><li>If you are allergic to polysorbate, you should not get the Janssen vaccine. Ask your doctor if you can get an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.</li><li>If you aren’t able to get one type of COVID-19 vaccine because you are allergic to an ingredient, ask your doctor if you should get a different vaccine.&nbsp;</li><li>If you aren’t able to get the second shot of an mRNA vaccine because you had an allergic reaction, ask your doctor if you should get a different vaccine.</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">People with underlying medical conditions can receive the FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines provided they have not had <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html">an immediate or severe allergic reaction</a> to a COVID-19 vaccine or to any of the ingredients in the vaccine. Learn more about vaccination <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/underlying-conditions.html">considerations for people with underlying medical conditions.</a> Vaccination is an important consideration for adults of any age with certain underlying medical conditions because they are at increased risk for severe illness from the virus that causes COVID-19.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">If I&#8217;m pregnant or breastfeeding, should I get the COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a> states that pregnant and lactating individuals can receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Experts have not identified any safety concerns for pregnant or lactating people who were vaccinated or their breastfeeding babies. The COVID-19 vaccines do not contain the live virus, so they cannot cause COVID-19.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Pregnant people are more likely to get severely ill with COVID-19 compared with non-pregnant people. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy can protect you from severe illness if you get COVID-19. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have questions about getting a COVID-19 vaccine.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">How long should I wait to get the vaccine after I’ve had COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fcovid-19%2Finfo-by-product%2Fpfizer%2Fclinical-considerations.html">CDC recommends:</a></p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>If you tested positive, had only mild symptoms, and were not treated for the coronavirus, you should wait at least 10 days after the start of COVID-19 symptoms <strong>and </strong>satisfy<strong> </strong><a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html">criteria</a> to discontinue isolation before getting the COVID-19 vaccine.</li><li>Wait 90 days to get the vaccine if you recovered from a COVID-19 infection and were treated with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma.</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I get a COVID-19 vaccine at the same time as another vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, you can get a COVID-19 vaccine and other vaccines at the same visit. You no longer need to wait 14 days between different vaccinations. Experience has shown that the way our bodies develop protection after getting vaccinated (immune response) and the level of&nbsp;side effects are generally the same when given alone or with other vaccines. Learn more about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html#Coadministration">getting more than one kind of vaccine</a>.</p>



<h3 id="Vaccine-choices">Vaccine choices</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will I have a choice between the various COVID-19 vaccines?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. <a href="https://vaccinefinder.org/search/">VaccineFinder</a> allows you the option to search for vaccines by manufacturer.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Are the COVID-19 vaccines mandatory?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No, there is no mandatory vaccination requirement from either the state or federal government.&nbsp;Once more and more Californians see how safe and effective the COVID-19 vaccines are, we hope they will voluntarily opt to receive them.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">May an employer require COVID-19 vaccination for all employees entering the workplace?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, if certain requirements are met. Under the ADA, an employer may require all employees to meet a qualification standard that is job-related and consistent with business necessity, such as a safety-related standard requiring COVID-19 vaccination. However, if a particular employee cannot meet such a safety-related qualification standard because of a disability, the employer may not require compliance for that employee unless the employer can demonstrate that the individual would pose a “direct threat” to the health or safety of the employee or others in the workplace.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">How can I convince my family and friends to take a COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Talking with family and friends about the benefits of getting a COVID-19 vaccine can be hard. You can help by listening without judgement and identifying the root of their concerns. Things to remember to help open the discussion include:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Listen to questions with empathy</li><li>Ask open-ended questions to explore concerns</li><li>Ask permission to share information</li><li>Help them find their own reason to get vaccinated</li><li>Help make their vaccination happen</li></ul>
