<h2>Who can get vaccinated</h2>



<p>Any Californian aged 5 and up can get vaccinated, for free.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your immigration or insurance status does not matter. No one will ask about your immigration status when you get vaccinated.</p>



<h3>Vaccines for kids</h3>

   <p class="caption">Vaccines are highly effective at preventing severe illness from COVID-19, including hospitalization and death.
</p>
    </div>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">COVID-19 vaccines teach our immune systems how to fight the virus that causes COVID-19. It is still possible to get COVID-19 after vaccination. But your symptoms will likely be much less severe, helping you avoid hospitalization and death.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>What we know</h3>



<ul><li>Vaccinations can prevent most COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths.</li><li>COVID-19 vaccines are effective against many <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID-Variants.aspx">variants</a> of the virus.</li><li>People with weakened immune systems may not be protected even if vaccinated.</li></ul>



<h3>What we’re still learning</h3>



<ul><li>How long COVID-19 vaccine protection lasts</li></ul>



<h3>Once you’re vaccinated</h3>



<p>Vaccination makes it safer to return to activities you did before the pandemic. But stay aware of public health recommendations that still apply to you.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator" id="Variants"/>



<h2>Vaccines and variants</h2>



<p>Vaccination has proven very effective against COVID-19 variants.&nbsp;The best thing we can do to protect ourselves from getting very sick from COVID-19 is to:</p>



<ul><li>Get vaccinated</li><li>Get your booster(s) when you’re eligible</li></ul>

<h2>Booster shots and additional doses</h2>



<h3>Booster shots</h3>



<p>Booster shots are now available for everyone 5 and older.</p>



<p>Get a booster shot as soon as you’re eligible:</p>



<ul><li>If you got a <strong>Moderna </strong>or <strong>Pfizer </strong>vaccine, get a booster shot after 5 months</li><li>If you got a <strong>Johnson &amp; Johnson</strong> vaccine, get a booster shot after 2 months</li></ul>



<p>Your booster shot can be a different vaccine brand than you got in your original series. A Pfizer or Moderna booster is strongly advised for those who got the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. Those aged 5-17 can only get a Pfizer booster.</p>



<p>To book your booster shot or find a walk-in clinic, visit <a href="https://myturn.ca.gov/">My Turn</a>.</p>



<p>See why the CDC urges you to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html">stay up to date with your vaccines</a>.</p>

<h3>Second booster shots</h3>



<p>The CDC now recommends a second booster shot with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for:</p>



<ul><li>People over 50</li><li>Those 12 or older who are immune-compromised</li></ul>



<p>Second booster doses are available for:</p>



<ul><li>Those who got two doses of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine</li></ul>



<p>You must have gotten your first booster dose at least 4 months ago. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0328-covid-19-boosters.html">See if you’re eligible</a>.</p>



<h3>Additional doses</h3>



<p>Additional doses of Pfizer or Moderna are available for those with compromised immunity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This includes people who:</p>



<ul><li>Get <strong>active cancer treatment</strong> for tumors or cancers of the blood</li><li>Got an <strong>organ transplant</strong> and are taking medicine to suppress the immune system</li><li>Got a <strong>stem cell transplant</strong> within the last 2 years or are taking medicine to suppress the immune system</li><li>Have <strong>moderate or severe primary immunodeficiency</strong> (such as DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome)</li><li>Have <strong>advanced or untreated HIV infection</strong></li><li>Get <strong>active treatment with high-dose corticosteroids</strong> or other drugs that suppress immune response</li></ul>



<p>Children aged 5-11 with these conditions can get an additional dose of Pfizer.</p>



<p>Talk to your doctor to see if getting an additional dose is right for you. If you meet these criteria, you can book your shot at <a href="https://myturn.ca.gov/">My Turn</a>.</p>

<h3>If you have trouble getting your record</h3>



<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">How can I fix errors in my vaccination record?</div>



<p>If you couldn’t get your vaccine record, you may need to correct or add some information.</p>



<p>What might prevent you from getting your COVID-19 vaccination record:</p>



<ul><li>Your vaccination site does not report to the state’s immunization systems</li><li>Your vaccination site didn’t report your vaccination</li><li>The information you entered doesn’t match your record in the registry</li></ul>

<hr class="wp-block-separator bd-top-darkblue" id="Side-effects"/>



<h2>Side effects</h2>



<p>After COVID-19 vaccination, you may have some mild side effects. These are normal signs that your body is building immunity. More serious side effects rarely happen.</p>



<h3>Mild side effects</h3>



<p>Common mild side effects include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Soreness, redness, or swelling where you got the shot</li><li>Feeling tired, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, or nausea</li></ul>



<p>Side effects may affect your ability to do daily activities, but should go away in a few days. Some people have no side effects.</p>



<h3>Rare but serious side effects</h3>



<h4>Blood clots</h4>



<p>Rarely, women under 50 who get the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine have a risk of blood clots with low platelets. This risk is not seen in other COVID-19 vaccines. Read CDPH’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/JnJ_factsheet.pdf">Fact Sheet: Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 Vaccine Benefits and Risks</a>.</p>



<h4>Myocarditis and pericarditis</h4>



<p>Some young people have developed inflammation of heart muscle or membrane after getting Pfizer or Moderna. Because this is very rare, the CDC says the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the risks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some people may consider waiting 8 weeks between doses of Moderna or Pfizer. More time between doses may reduce the risk of myocarditis. Males aged 12-39 may benefit the most from waiting 8 weeks.</p>

<h3>Reporting side effects of vaccines</h3>



<p>If you have experienced a side effect after COVID-19 vaccination, you can report it to:</p>

<h3 class="When to call the doctor" id="When-to-call-the-doctor">When to call the doctor</h3>



<p>In most cases, discomfort from pain or fever is a normal sign that your body is building protection. Contact your doctor or healthcare provider if:</p>



<ul><li>The redness or tenderness where you got the shot gets worse after 24 hours</li><li>Your side effects are worrying you or do not seem to be going away after a few days</li></ul>



<p>If you get a COVID-19 vaccine and you have a severe reaction, seek immediate medical care by calling 911. Learn more about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html">COVID-19 vaccines and rare severe allergic reactions</a>.</p>

<h2>Questions and answers</h2>



<h3 id="Getting-vaccinated">Getting vaccinated</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How many COVID-19 vaccine doses do I need, and how far apart should I get them?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The following dosage is for people who are not immune-compromised.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">For Pfizer:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Two doses 3-8 weeks apart, then</li><li>First booster shot 5 months later, then</li><li>For people age 50+, a second booster shot 4 months later</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">For Moderna:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Two doses 4-8 weeks apart, then&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>First booster shot 5 months later, then</li><li>For people age 50+, a second booster shot 4 months later</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Talk to your healthcare or vaccine provider about the timing for the second dose in your primary series. You should&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;get the second dose early.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">For Johnson &amp; Johnson:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>One dose, then&nbsp;</li><li>First booster shot 2 months later, then</li><li>Second booster shot 4 months later if the first booster shot was the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The CDC now recommends the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine instead of Johnson &amp; Johnson. These are also the preferred booster doses for those who first got Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">People who are immune-compromised need additional doses at different times. See the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html">CDC’s vaccine recommendations for the immune-compromised</a>. </p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Read <a href="#Booster-shots-and-additional-doses" data-type="internal" data-id="#Booster-shots-and-additional-doses">Booster shots and additional doses</a> to see if you are eligible.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I mix and match COVID-19 vaccines from different manufacturers?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, after you complete your first vaccination series. In the United States, that means:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Two shots of the Pfizer vaccine, or&nbsp;</li><li>Two shots of the Moderna vaccine, or&nbsp;</li><li>One shot of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Then you may choose another vaccine to receive as a booster dose. Some people may prefer the vaccine they got before, and others may prefer to get a different booster. CDC recommendations now allow for this type of mix-and-match dosing for booster doses.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Children aged 5-17 may only get the Pfizer vaccine.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">A Pfizer or Moderna booster is strongly advised for those who got the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What if I was vaccinated outside the United States? Can I get a vaccination or a booster here?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Here’s what the CDC recommends:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>If you were vaccinated outside the U.S. with a vaccine approved or authorized by the FDA, you can get a second dose, booster dose, or additional dose. You must follow <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines.html">U.S. eligibility and timing schedules</a>.</li><li>If you got one or both doses of a World Health Organization (WHO) Emergency Use Listed (EUL) vaccine, you can get a second dose, booster dose, or additional dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. You must follow <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines.html">U.S. eligibility and timing schedules</a>.</li><li>If you got a COVID-19 vaccine that’s not WHO-EUL, you should start over. Get an FDA-authorized/approved vaccine and follow its <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines.html">timing schedule</a>.</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Schedule your vaccination at <a href="https://myturn.ca.gov/">My Turn</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How much will the COVID-19 vaccine cost?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Nothing. COVID-19 vaccinations are free.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Do I need to be a California resident to get a COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. Vaccine eligibility is based on age. Residency or immigration status does not matter.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How do I cancel or reschedule my vaccine appointment through My Turn?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you need to cancel or reschedule your appointment, you can do so on the <a href="https://myturn.ca.gov/manage">Manage your appointments</a> page.</p>

<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Your appointment confirmation number, and&nbsp;</li><li>Either your cell phone number or your email address.</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">I’ve already had COVID-19. Should I get a COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. The CDC recommends that people who have already had COVID-19 get a COVID-19 vaccine.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">We do not know how long your protection lasts from getting infected again after you recover.&nbsp;People who get vaccinated after infection have additional protection against COVID-19.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">One <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7032e1.htm?s_cid=mm7032e1_e&amp;ACSTrackingID=USCDC_921-DM63289&amp;ACSTrackingLabel=MMWR%20Early%20Release%20-%20Vol.%2070%2C%20August%206%2C%202021&amp;deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM63289">study</a> showed that unvaccinated people who already had COVID-19 are more than twice as likely as vaccinated people to get it again.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I get vaccinated against COVID-19 while I am currently sick with COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. Wait until you have recovered and have met the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html">criteria for ending isolation</a>. This guidance also applies to people who get COVID-19 between their first and second dose.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will COVID-19 vaccine sites be accessible?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. All vaccine clinics in California are required to meet ADA requirements.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How do I get a COVID-19 vaccine at home if I am unable to travel to a vaccine site?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Check with your healthcare provider, local health department, or local pharmacy.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">What does it mean to be “vaccinated and boosted”?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">People are considered vaccinated and boosted for COVID-19:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>After they receive two doses in a 2-dose series (Pfizer or Moderna), and one booster dose, or</li><li>After they receive a single-dose vaccine (Johnson &amp; Johnson) and one booster dose.</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Second booster doses are not required to be considered vaccinated and boosted.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will the COVID-19 vaccine make me test positive for COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. A vaccine will not cause you to test positive on <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html">viral tests</a>.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If your body develops an immune response, you may test positive on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html">antibody tests</a>. This shows that you may have protection against the virus.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How is my privacy protected if I take the COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>

<h3 id="Vaccination-for-children">Vaccination for children</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Do providers need parental consent before administering&nbsp;a COVID-19 vaccine to a minor?&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Before vaccinating a minor, vaccine providers must get consent from a:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Parent,&nbsp;</li><li>Legal guardian, or&nbsp;</li><li>Other adults having legal custody.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">There are some exceptions:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=FAM&amp;sectionNum=7050.">Emancipated minors</a> do not need the consent of a parent or guardian to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.</li><li>Providers may accept written consent. It must be from the parent or legal guardian of an unaccompanied minor. This consent must verify the parent/guardian has received the<a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download"> Pfizer EUA Fact Sheet</a>.</li><li>Phone or video consent is acceptable. The parent/guardian must confirm that they received the<a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download"> Pfizer EUA Fact Sheet</a>. Reading the fact sheet to the parent/guardian is an option.</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Families should check with their vaccine provider on acceptable forms of consent. See CDPH’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Pfizer-Vaccine-Minor-Consent-Guidance.aspx">Pfizer Vaccine Minor Consent Guidance</a> for more details.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Why should I vaccinate my child?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Cases in children are increasing. We must get young people vaccinated to prevent more hospitalizations and deaths.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Vaccinations protect children from the most severe outcomes of COVID-19, such as MIS-C, hospitalization, and death. They can also shrink the pool of people vulnerable to COVID-19. By getting children 5 and up vaccinated, families can be safer as we get back to doing the things we love.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">My child has had reactions to other vaccines. Should they still get the vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, unless they have had life-threatening allergic (anaphylactic) reactions to components of the Pfizer vaccine. Allergic reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine are rare. Talk to your child’s doctor before vaccination if they’ve had: <strong>  </strong></p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Severe allergies</li><li>Flu vaccination reactions</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can children who have pre-existing conditions like asthma get vaccinated?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Youth aged 5 and up can still receive the COVID-19 vaccine even if they have health conditions. Talk to your doctor or clinic about your child’s specific conditions.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Why did it take longer for the COVID-19 vaccine to be approved for youth?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Vaccine trials commonly begin with older, more vulnerable populations. They then extend to younger ages. This phased eligibility approach balances the need for both safety and speed.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Clinical trials in more than 4,500 children ages 5-11 prove the COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective. It results in a strong antibody response in children who received the vaccines.</p>



<h3 id="Vaccines-allocation-and-distribution">Vaccinations for employees</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">I&#8217;m an employer and want to help my employees get vaccinated. How do I do that?</h4>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can an employer require COVID-19 vaccination for all employees entering a workplace?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, if certain requirements are met. Under the ADA, an employer may insist all employees to meet a standard that is:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Job-related, and&nbsp;</li><li>Meets with a business need</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">This could include a safety-related standard requiring COVID-19 vaccination.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If an employee cannot be vaccinated because of a disability, the employer may not require them to. The exception to that is if the employee’s non-compliance poses a threat to their health or safety or that of others in the workplace.</p>

<h3 id="Vaccine-limitations">Vaccine limitations</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">If I get a COVID-19 vaccine, will I still need a flu shot?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. COVID-19 vaccine does not provide protection against flu.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Are there certain populations who should not get a COVID-19 vaccine? What about people with allergies?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html">CDC recommends</a> that:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>If you had a severe reaction to an mRNA vaccine or its ingredients:<ul><li>Do not get the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. </li><li>Ask your doctor if you can get the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.</li></ul></li><li>If you had a severe reaction to the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine or its ingredients:<ul><li>Do not get it again. </li><li>Ask your doctor if you can get the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine.</li></ul></li><li>If you had an immediate allergic reaction after getting the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, but the reaction was not considered severe by a medical professional:<ul><li>You likely can receive another dose of the same vaccine under certain conditions.

<h4 class="wp-accordion">If I&#8217;m pregnant or breastfeeding, should I get the COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. The CDC strongly recommends that if you’re pregnant or or could be pregnant, you get vaccinated. If you get COVID-19 while you are pregnant, you are more likely to get severely ill. Additionally, you are at increased risk of complications that can affect your pregnancy and developing baby, including premature birth.  </p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The vaccines are safe for you and your baby. They do not contain the live virus, so they cannot cause COVID-19. Vaccination during pregnancy might help protect your baby from COVID-19 by building antibodies in your blood and milk that is shared with the baby.</p>
