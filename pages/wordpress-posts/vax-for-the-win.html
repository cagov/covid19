<h4 class="wp-accordion">I got a call about Vax for the Win that seemed fraudulent. What should I do?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Winners will be notified by the California Department of Public Health and will not be asked to pay any fees associated with verifying eligibility for the cash prize.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Any fraudulent activities or misinformation can be reported to <a href="mailto:rumors@cdph.ca.gov">rumors@cdph.ca.gov</a>.

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Is personal health information shared through these vaccine incentive programs?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No, Californians' personal health information is not shared by these programs. The Lottery will assist the programs, but will not receive personally-identifiable information. All entries will be anonymous to them.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The names of winners won't be disclosed without their consent. However, the county of the winner could be announced. The state will ensure the drawings are fair, honest, legal, and protective of personal information.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">How long will the incentive cards last? When will the program run out?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Cards are only available for the first 2 million eligible individuals. To be eligible, you must start your vaccination process on May 27 or later.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How do I book a COVID-19 vaccination appointment?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You can schedule appointments or find walk-in clinics at <a href="http://myturn.ca.gov">myturn.ca.gov</a>. You can also use other websites or hotlines provided by the CDC or local health departments. Appointments can also be made by calling the California COVID-19 Hotline at 1-833-422-4255.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">If I got my first dose before the incentive card program started, then get my second dose after it started, am I eligible?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No, you are not eligible to receive an incentive card. But you are eligible for the other cash prizes. The purpose of the card program is to motivate unvaccinated Californians to get vaccinated before the state fully reopens on June 15.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I get the $50 incentive card if I completed my vaccination before the program started?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. The incentive card program is intended to motivate the remaining Californians to get vaccinated before the state fully reopens on June 15. However, fully vaccinated Californians are eligible for other cash prizes.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How long after redeeming the incentive card does it take to receive it?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It takes up to five business days to receive the incentive card. If you have not received your card after five business days, call 1-833-993-3873.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How will people prove they’ve had both doses? What if someone tries to cheat with a fake vaccine card?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">COVID-19 vaccines are tracked in California immunization records. Incentive cards and other cash prizes will be awarded based on those records.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What if I got vaccinated, but did not receive my code?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you do not receive a code after 14 days, call 833-993-3873.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What if I get vaccinated outside of California’s My Turn system?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You do not need to vaccinate through My Turn to be eligible. You are still eligible if your vaccination site is in California and reports doses given to the state.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What if I opted to not share my data with <strong>the Immunization Information System</strong>s (IIS)?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The data is still reported to the state, so you would still be eligible for the incentive and other cash prizes.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Is there a choice of incentive cards?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, there are three choices:</p>



<ol class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Virtual Mastercard®: Not an ATM card so it cannot be cashed out. It can be redeemed online where Debit Mastercard® is accepted. This is a virtual incentive card and can be added to a phone mobile wallet.</li><li>Kroger: Good at Ralphs, Food 4 Less and Foods Co. We recommend printing the card, as not all grocery stores can scan it on a phone.</li><li>Albertsons: Good at Safeway, Albertsons, Vons, Pavilions, and Andronico's Community Markets. We recommend printing the card, as not all grocery stores can scan it on a phone.</li></ol>
