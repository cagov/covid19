<h4 class="wp-accordion">Are Californians who already completed their full vaccination prior to the program eligible for the incentive card?</h4>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">What if I opted to not share my data with <strong>the Immunization Information System</strong>s (IIS)?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The data is still reported to the state, so you would still be eligible for the incentive and other cash prizes.</p>
