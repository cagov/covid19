<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I get the $50 incentive card if I completed my vaccination before the program started?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. The incentive card program is intended to motivate the remaining Californians to get vaccinated before the state fully reopens on June 15. However, fully vaccinated Californians are eligible for other cash prizes.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How do I get my redemption code?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you get vaccinated on or after May 27, you’ll get a redemption code by text or email within 7-10 days after your last vaccination. For those receiving a two-dose series, your $50 card will be set aside until your completed second dose.</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>If you do not have a mobile phone or email address, then 7-10 days after your vaccination, you can call 1-833-993-3873 to receive a physical card.</li><li>If you don’t have a permanent address, then 7-10 days after your vaccination, call 1-833-993-3873 to coordinate delivery of your $50 card.</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How long after redeeming the incentive card does it take to receive it?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">COVID-19 vaccines are tracked in California immunization records. Incentive cards and other cash prizes will be awarded based on those records.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What if I got vaccinated, but did not receive my code?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you do not receive a code after 14 days, call 833-993-3873.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What if I get vaccinated outside of California’s My Turn system?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You do not need to vaccinate through My Turn to be eligible. You are still eligible if your vaccination site is in California and reports doses given to the state.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What if I opted to not share my data with <strong>the Immunization Information System</strong>s (IIS)?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The data is still reported to the state, so you would still be eligible for the incentive and other cash prizes.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Is there a choice of incentive cards?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, there are three choices:</p>



<ol class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Virtual Mastercard®: Not an ATM card so it cannot be cashed out. It can be redeemed online where Debit Mastercard® is accepted. This is a virtual incentive card and can be added to a phone mobile wallet.</li><li>Kroger: Good at Ralphs, Food 4 Less and Foods Co. We recommend printing the card, as not all grocery stores can scan it on a phone.</li><li>Albertsons: Good at Safeway, Albertsons, Vons, Pavilions, and Andronico's Community Markets. We recommend printing the card, as not all grocery stores can scan it on a phone.</li></ol>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Who pays for this program?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">This program is being paid for by the State of California.</p>
