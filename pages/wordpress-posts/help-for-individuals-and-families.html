<h3>Federal Child Tax Credit</h3>



<p>If you have children, you may be eligible for the federal <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/child-tax-credit/">Child Tax Credit</a> (CTC), even if you make little or no money.</p>



<p>The CTC amount you may qualify for depends on:</p>



<ul><li>Your income</li><li>Your tax filing status</li><li>The number of children you claim</li></ul>



<p>Learn <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5534b.pdf">the basics about the federal CTC</a>.</p>



<h4>How to get the CTC</h4>



<p>If you qualify, you will receive the CTC if you’ve done any of these:</p>



<ul><li>Filed a 2019 or a 2020 tax return</li><li>Gave the IRS your information using a non-filer portal</li><li>Gave the IRS your information to receive the Economic Impact Payment</li></ul>

<h4>Monthly payments</h4>



<p>You do not have to wait until you file your taxes in 2022 to start getting the CTC. You can get half of your CTC money in 2021 as advance monthly payments. You will get the other half when you file your tax return in 2022.</p>



<p>From July 2021 through December 2021, you can get monthly CTC payments up to:</p>



<ul><li>$300 per child under age 6</li><li>$250 per child ages 6 to 17</li></ul>

<h3>California’s child tax credits</h3>



<p>State tax credits are available to working Californians that have children. This includes undocumented workers.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>California Earned Income Tax Credit (CalEITC)</h4>



<p>If you’re working for a low wage, you can get money back based on how much you earned and how many children you have. If you made $30,000 or less in 2020, you may qualify for the <a href="https://www.caleitc4me.org/what-is-the-caleitc/">CalEITC</a>. </p>



<p>The CalEITC is a tax credit that can reduce the amount of taxes you owe or increase your tax refund amount. Getting CalEITC does not prevent you from qualifying for any other benefits.</p>



<h4>Young Child Tax Credit (YCTC)&nbsp;</h4>



<p>You may qualify for the <a href="https://www.caleitc4me.org/young-child-tax-credit/">Young Child Tax Credit</a> (YCTC) of up to $1,000 if you:</p>



<ul><li>Qualified for CalEITC, and&nbsp;</li><li>Have a child that was under age 6 on December 31, 2020</li></ul>



<p>If you qualify, you could get a bigger tax refund or a reduced tax bill.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>How to get these tax credits</h4>



<p>You must file your state tax return to claim both the CalEITC and the YCTC. <a href="https://www.caleitc4me.org/fileyourtaxes/">File your taxes</a> online for free.&nbsp;If&nbsp;you do not have a Social Security Number, file your taxes with an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN).
