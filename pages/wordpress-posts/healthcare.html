<p>Health care coverage — including coronavirus testing for people who need it — should be affordable for all Californians.<br> </p>



<p>All patients with full-service Medi-Cal or commercial insurance in California will have copays, coinsurance and deductibles waived for COVID-19 <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/">testing</a> and screening.  &nbsp;<a href="https://www.medicare.gov/medicare-coronavirus">Medicare</a> and <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/sign-up-change-plans/types-of-medicare-health-plans/medicare-advantage-plans">Medicare Advantage Plans</a> cover <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-tests">coronavirus tests</a> and <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-antibody-test">antibody </a>tests, with no out-of-pocket costs. The cost of coronavirus screening, testing, and treatment for the uninsured is paid for by the <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/CovidUninsuredClaim">government</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you don’t have health care coverage or recently lost employer-sponsored health care coverage, see the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/img/CoverageOptionsFactSheet.pdf"><a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/img/CoverageOptionsFactSheet.pdf">Health Care Coverage Options Factsheet (PDF)</a></a> to get covered.</p>



<h2 id="questions">Questions and answers</h2>



<h2><strong>Cloth face covering and masks</strong></h2>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong><strong><strong>Should I use a </strong><a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/#top"><strong>cloth face covering or mask</strong></a><strong> to protect against COVID-19?</strong></strong></strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. When you leave home for activities permitted in your area, you should wear a <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/#top">cloth face covering or mask</a>.  The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) has released <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Face-Coverings-Guidance.aspx">Guidance<strong> </strong>on Use of Cloth Face Coverings</a>.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The cloth face coverings recommended are <strong>not </strong>medical grade respirators, such as N95 and surgical masks.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The guidance reminds Californians that the best defense against COVID-19 continues to be:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Stay at home and keep six feet from others&nbsp;</li><li>Wash hands frequently</li><li>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands</li><li>Avoid being around people with COVID-19 symptoms</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The use of cloth face coverings could reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and may reinforce physical distancing.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong><strong>What is a </strong><a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/#top"><strong>cloth face covering</strong></a><strong>?</strong></strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">A cloth face covering is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">material that covers the nose and mouth</a>. It can be secured to the head with ties or straps or simply wrapped around the lower face. It can be made of a variety of materials, such as cotton, silk, or linen. A cloth face covering may be factory-made or sewn by hand, or can be improvised from household items such as scarfs, T-shirts, sweatshirts, or towels.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>How should I care for a </strong><a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/#top"><strong>cloth face covering</strong></a><strong>?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It’s a good idea to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">wash your cloth face covering</a> frequently, ideally after each use. Have a bag or bin to keep cloth face coverings in until they can be laundered with detergent and hot water and dried on a hot cycle. If you must re-wear your cloth face covering before washing, wash your hands immediately after putting it back on and avoid touching your face. Discard cloth face coverings that:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>No longer cover the nose and mouth</li><li>Have stretched out or damaged ties or straps</li><li>Cannot stay on the face</li><li>Have holes or tears in the fabric</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Insurance &amp; cost</strong></h2>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong><strong>What if I don’t have health insurance and I need screening,&nbsp; testing, or treatment for COVID-19?</strong></strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The cost of coronavirus screening, testing, and treatment for the uninsured is paid for by the <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/CovidUninsuredClaim">government</a>. You can check your symptoms using the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsymptoms-testing%2Findex.html">Symptom Screener</a> or by contacting your doctor through <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/telehealth/">telehealth</a>. You can also get free <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/">testing</a> through <a href="https://www.projectbaseline.com/study/covid-19/eligibility/">Verily&#8217;s Project Baseline</a> or <a href="https://lhi.care/covidtesting">OptumServe</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>I want to get screened or tested for COVID-19. I have insurance, but what will this cost me out-of-pocket?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Nothing. The state agencies that regulate health care in California have mandated that all full-service insurance plans (including Medi-Cal) waive copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles for medically necessary screening and testing for COVID-19. This includes emergency room, urgent care, or provider office visits when the purpose of the visit is to be screened and tested for COVID-19.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/">Testing</a> for COVID-19 is covered by insurance, Medicare, and Medi-Cal. If you have no insurance, it’s paid for by the <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/CovidUninsuredClaim">government</a>. As a first step, you can check your symptoms using the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsymptoms-testing%2Findex.html">Symptom Screener</a> or by contacting your doctor through <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/telehealth/">telehealth</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>I have a concern or complaint about getting care for COVID-19 under my health insurance. What can I do?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you are having trouble accessing care, or were inappropriately charged for medically necessary screening, testing, or treatment for COVID-19, follow up directly with your health plan by calling the member phone number listed on your health plan card. If your health plan doesn’t resolve the issue, contact the <a href="https://www.healthhelp.ca.gov/">California Department of Managed Health </a><a href="https://github.com/cagov/covid19/issues/www.HealthHelp.ca.gov">Care</a> (DMHC) Help Center for assistance at 1-888-466-2219.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>Do Medicare or Medicare Advantage Plans cover coronavirus tests or coronavirus antibody tests?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Both <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/medicare-coronavirus">Medicare</a> and <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/sign-up-change-plans/types-of-medicare-health-plans/medicare-advantage-plans">Medicare Advantage Plans</a> cover <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-tests">coronavirus tests</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-antibody-test">antibody </a>tests, with no out-of-pocket costs.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>Can I use telehealth if I am on Medicare?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Medicare has temporarily expanded its coverage of <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/telehealth">telehealth services (medical care via phone, video chat, or online portal)</a> to respond to the current Public Health Emergency. You can now use a wide range of communication tools (including smartphone) from home to interact with a range of providers, like doctors, nurse practitioners, clinical psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech language pathologists. If you have original Medicare, you can get many services without a copayment through <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/telehealth/">telehealth,</a> including evaluation and management visits (common office visits), mental health counseling, and preventive health screenings.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you have a <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/sign-up-change-plans/types-of-medicare-health-plans/medicare-advantage-plans">Medicare Advantage Plan</a>, you have access to these same benefits. Many plans offer additional <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/telehealth/">telehealth</a> benefits and expanded benefits, like meal delivery or medical transport services. Check with your plan about your coverage and costs.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong><strong>What about routine, elective, or non-urgent medical or dental</strong></strong> <strong><strong>appointments?</strong></strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Preventive care services and non-emergency surgeries, like organ replacements and tumor removals, can take place if hospitals have enough capacity and protective equipment to do so safely. Eye exams, and elective procedures should be cancelled or rescheduled.

<h2>Helping family or friends</h2>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong><strong>How can I make sure the older Californians in my life are safe and healthy during the stay home order?</strong></strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You should check in on your older neighbors and loved ones with a call, text, or physically-distanced door knock to make sure they are okay.

The most important thing you can do is to keep in touch with older loved ones for their mental health and safety.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong><strong>Can I leave home to care for my elderly parents or friends who require assistance? Or a friend or family member who has disabilities?</strong></strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes.

<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong><strong>Can I visit loved ones in the hospital, nursing home, skilled nursing facility, or other residential care facility?</strong></strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Generally, no. There are limited exceptions, such as if you are going to the hospital with a minor who is under 18 or someone who is developmentally disabled and needs assistance. For most other situations, the order prohibits visitation to these kinds of facilities. This is difficult, but necessary to protect hospital staff and other patients. Check the <a href="https://www.aging.ca.gov/download.ashx?lE0rcNUV0zaaXLD5JZ%2f6Uw%3d%3d">frequently asked questions for friends and family with a loved one in a skilled nursing or residential care facility</a> for more detailed information.<!-- elderly, disability, senior --></p>
