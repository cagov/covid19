<p>Health care — including needed coronavirus testing — should be affordable for all Californians.<br> </p>



<p>If you have <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/#top">COVID-19 symptoms</a> or think you were exposed to it, testing is free for you. In all other circumstances, you may have a co-pay.</p>

<h2 id="questions">Questions and answers</h2>



<h3>Insurance and cost</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What if I don’t have health insurance and I need COVID-19 diagnosis, testing or treatment?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The cost of needed COVID-19&nbsp;diagnosis, testing and treatment for the uninsured is <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/CovidUninsuredClaim">paid for by the government</a>. Check your symptoms using the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsymptoms-testing%2Findex.html">Symptom Screener</a> or by talking to your doctor. Medically necessary <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/">testing</a> is also free through Verily&#8217;s Project Baseline or OptumServe</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Does my health plan have to cover my COVID-19 test?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, if you:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Have COVID-19 symptoms,</li><li>Were exposed to someone who has COVID-19, or</li><li>The test is medically necessary for your situation.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you have COVID-19 symptoms or think you’ve been exposed, under federal law, you can get a test anywhere and your health plan must pay for it.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you are an <a href="https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/Portals/0/Docs/DO/DMHC-FAQForHealthCoverageOfCOVID-19Testing.pdf">essential worker</a>, your health plan must cover your COVID-19 test. But you must contact your health plan before getting tested.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If none of these things above are true but you’d still like a test, contact your health plan or health care provider.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">As a first step, you can check your symptoms using the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsymptoms-testing%2Findex.html">Symptom Screener</a> or by contacting your doctor.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How long will I have to wait to get a coronavirus test?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Your wait time<strong> </strong>depends on why you are seeking a test.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong>If you have COVID-19 symptoms or think you were exposed,</strong> under federal law, you can go immediately to any testing site. Find a testing site on our <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/#top">Testing page</a>, or call your health plan for an available testing location.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong>If you are an <a href="https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/Portals/0/Docs/DO/DMHC-FAQForHealthCoverageOfCOVID-19Testing.pdf">essential worker</a>, </strong>your health plan must offer you a test appointment within 48 hours. The testing site must be within 15 miles or 30 minutes of your home or workplace. If your health plan can’t find you such an appointment, then you can go to any available testing site. Your health plan will pay for the test.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong>If neither of these cases above are true,</strong> your provider may still decide that a COVID-19 test is medically necessary for you. In that case, your health plan must offer you a test appointment within 96 hours. The testing site must be within 15 miles or 30 minutes of your home or workplace. If your health plan can’t find you such an appointment, then you can go to any available testing site.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">I get my health care coverage through my employer, who has a “self-insured” plan. Do the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) regulations apply to me?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Self-insured plans are regulated by the federal government, not the state. If you have COVID-19 symptoms or were exposed to someone with symptoms, under federal law, your self-insured plan must cover your test. In all other instances, you should talk to your plan to find out whether they will cover COVID-19 testing.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How does my health plan know if I’m an essential worker?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Your health plan can ask you questions about why you want a COVID-19 test and about the nature of your work. This helps them determine whether a COVID-19 test is medically necessary for you.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">But they can’t ask you to provide further documentation or evidence of your work status. For example, they can’t ask you to provide written proof of where you work or the conditions of your workplace.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">I have a concern or complaint about getting care for COVID-19 under my health insurance. What can I do?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you can’t access care, or were charged in error, follow up with your health plan. Call the member phone number listed on your health plan card. If they don’t fix the problem, call the <a href="http://www.dmhc.ca.gov/?referral=healthhelp.ca.gov">California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC)</a> Help Center at  <a href="tel:888-466-2219">1-888-466-2219</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Both <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/medicare-coronavirus">Medicare</a> and <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/sign-up-change-plans/types-of-medicare-health-plans/medicare-advantage-plans">Medicare Advantage Plans</a> cover <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-tests">diagnostic</a> and <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-antibody-test">antibody tests</a>, with no out-of-pocket costs.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I use telehealth if I am on Medicare?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Medicare has expanded its <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/telehealth">telehealth services </a>to respond to the public health emergency. You can now use your smartphone, video chat, or online portal from home to talk with a range of providers, like doctors, nurse practitioners, clinical psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech language pathologists. If you have original Medicare, you can get many services for free through <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/telehealth/">telehealth</a>. This includes common office visits, mental health counseling, and preventive health screenings.</p>
