<p>Health care — including needed coronavirus testing — should be affordable for all Californians.<br> </p>



<p>If you have <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/#top">COVID-19 symptoms</a> or think you were exposed to it, testing is free for you. In all other circumstances, you may have a co-pay.</p>



<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">Can I get free COVID-19 testing or treatment if I am a senior over 65, disabled, uninsured, or an undocumented immigrant?</div>

<h2 id="questions">Questions and answers</h2>



<h3>Insurance and cost</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What if I don’t have health insurance and I need COVID-19 diagnosis, testing or treatment?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The cost of needed COVID-19 diagnosis, testing and treatment for the uninsured is <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/CovidUninsuredClaim">paid for by the government</a>. Check your symptoms using the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsymptoms-testing%2Findex.html">Symptom Screener</a> or by talking to your doctor. Medically necessary <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/">testing</a> is also free through Verily&#8217;s Project Baseline or OptumServe</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Does my health plan have to cover my COVID-19 test?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, if you:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Have COVID-19 symptoms,</li><li>Were exposed to someone who has COVID-19, or</li><li>The test is medically necessary for your situation.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you have COVID-19 symptoms or think you’ve been exposed, under federal law, you can get a test anywhere and your health plan must pay for it.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you are an <a href="https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/Portals/0/Docs/DO/DMHC-FAQForHealthCoverageOfCOVID-19Testing.pdf">essential worker</a>, your health plan must cover your COVID-19 test. But you must contact your health plan before getting tested.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If none of these things above are true but you’d still like a test, contact your health plan or health care provider.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">As a first step, you can check your symptoms using the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsymptoms-testing%2Findex.html">Symptom Screener</a> or by contacting your doctor.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How long will I have to wait to get a test?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Your wait time<strong> </strong>depends on why you are seeking a test.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong>If you have COVID-19 symptoms or think you were exposed,</strong> under federal law, you can go immediately to any testing site. Find a testing site on our <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/#top">Testing page</a>, or call your health plan for an available testing location.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong>If you are an <a href="https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/Portals/0/Docs/DO/DMHC-FAQForHealthCoverageOfCOVID-19Testing.pdf">essential worker</a>, </strong>your health plan must offer you a test appointment within 48 hours. The testing site must be within 15 miles or 30 minutes of your homeor workplace. If yourhealth plan can’t find you such an appointment, then you can go to any available testing site. Your health plan will pay for the test. </p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong>If neither of these cases above are true,</strong> your provider may still decide that a COVID-19 test is medically necessary for you. In that case, your health plan must offer you a test appointment within 96 hours. The testing site must be within 15 miles or 30 minutes of your homeor workplace. If your health plan can’t find you such an appointment, then you can go to any available testing site.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">I get my health care coverage through my employer, who has a “self-insured” plan. Do the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) regulations apply to me?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Self-insured plans are regulated by the federal government, rather than the state. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 or you were exposed to someone who you know or suspect has COVID-19, under federal law, your employer’s self-insured plan must cover your test. In all other instances, you should talk to your employer’s self-insured plan to find out whether they will cover COVID-19 testing.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How does my health plan know if I’m an essential worker?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Your health plan can ask you questions about why you want a COVID-19 test and about the nature of your work. They can ask these questions to help determine whether a COVID-19 test is medically necessary for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">However, your health plan can’t ask you to provide further documentation or evidence of your work status. For example, your health plan can’t ask you to provide written proof of where you work or the conditions of your workplace.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">I have a concern or complaint about getting care for COVID-19 under my health insurance. What can I do?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you are having trouble accessing care, or were inappropriately charged for medically necessary screening, testing, or treatment for COVID-19, follow up directly with your health plan by calling the member phone number listed on your health plan card. If your health plan doesn’t resolve the issue, contact the <a href="http://www.dmhc.ca.gov/?referral=healthhelp.ca.gov">California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC)</a> Help Center for assistance at 1-888-466-2219.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Do Medicare or Medicare Advantage Plans cover coronavirus tests or coronavirus antibody tests?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Both <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/medicare-coronavirus">Medicare</a> and <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/sign-up-change-plans/types-of-medicare-health-plans/medicare-advantage-plans">Medicare Advantage Plans</a> cover <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-tests">coronavirus tests</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-antibody-test">antibody </a>tests, with no out-of-pocket costs.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I use telehealth if I am on Medicare?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Medicare has temporarily expanded its coverage of <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/telehealth">telehealth services (medical care via phone, video chat, or online portal)</a> to respond to the current Public Health Emergency. You can now use a wide range of communication tools (including smartphone) from home to interact with a range of providers, like doctors, nurse practitioners, clinical psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech language pathologists. If you have original Medicare, you can get many services without a copayment through <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/telehealth/">telehealth,</a> including evaluation and management visits (common office visits), mental health counseling, and preventive health screenings.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you have a <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/sign-up-change-plans/types-of-medicare-health-plans/medicare-advantage-plans">Medicare Advantage Plan</a>, you have access to these same benefits. Many plans offer additional <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/telehealth/">telehealth</a> benefits and expanded benefits, like meal delivery or medical transport services. Check with your plan about your coverage and costs.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What COVID-19 testing and treatments are covered by the federal government&#8217;s free uninsured program?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The following services are covered by the federal government if you are&nbsp; uninsured and diagnosed with a primary COVID-19 diagnosis:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Specimen collection, diagnostic and antibody testing</li><li>Testing-related visits, including in the following settings: office, urgent care, emergency room, or telehealth</li><li>Treatment, including office visit, <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/telehealth/#top">telehealth</a>, emergency room, inpatient, outpatient/observation, skilled nursing facility, long-term acute care (LTAC), acute inpatient rehab, home health, Durable Medical Equipment (DME) like oxygen and ventilator, emergency ambulance transportation, non-emergent patient transfers via ambulance, and FDA-approved drugs as they become available for COVID-19 treatment and administered as part of an inpatient stay</li><li>FDA-approved vaccine, when available</li></ul>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Does Medi-Cal provide free COVID-19 diagnosis, testing and treatments for the uninsured?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. <a href="https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/services/medi-cal/eligibility/Pages/COVID-19-Presumptive-Eligibility-Program.aspx#:~:text=Presumptive%20Eligibility%20(PE)%20for%20COVID,associated%20office%2C%20clinic%2C%20or%20emergency">Medi-Cal is available</a> to individuals with no insurance or who currently have private insurance that does not cover COVID-19 diagnostic testing and testing-related services. Due to the current public health emergency, COVID-19 testing, evaluation, and treatment services are deemed emergency services. This allows all Medi-Cal beneficiaries, regardless of their scope of coverage under Medi-Cal or their immigration status, to receive at no cost all medically necessary testing, testing-related, and treatment services, which may include inpatient or outpatient services related to a COVID-19 diagnosis.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">What about routine, elective, or non-urgent medical or dental appointments?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Preventive care services and non-emergency surgeries, like organ replacements and tumor removals, can take place if hospitals have enough capacity and protective equipment to do so safely. Eye exams, and elective procedures should be cancelled or rescheduled. If possible, health care visits should be done remotely. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/dental-settings.html">Dental services and preventive dental care</a> may be resumed. Contact your doctor through <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/telehealth/">telehealth</a> to see what services they are providing.</p>

<h3>Helping family or friends</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How can I make sure the older Californians in my life are safe and healthy during the stay home order?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You should check in on your older neighbors and loved ones with a call, text, or physically-distanced door knock to make sure they are okay. You can also teach them how to use FaceTime, Zoom, Google Duo or Facebook video to communicate. The most important thing you can do is to keep in touch with older loved ones for their mental health and safety.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I leave home to care for my elderly parents or friends who require assistance? Or a friend or family member who has disabilities?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes.
