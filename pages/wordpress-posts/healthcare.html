<h2 id="questions">Questions and answers</h2>



<h2><strong>Cloth face covering and masks</strong></h2>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong><strong>Should I use cloth face coverings or masks to protect against COVID-19?</strong></strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes,&nbsp; when you must leave home to conduct activities permitted under the current roadmap stage, you should wear a cloth face covering or mask. The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) has released <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Face-Coverings-Guidance.aspx">Guidance on Use of Cloth Face Coverings</a>.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The cloth face coverings recommended are <strong>not </strong>medical grade respirators, such as N95 and surgical masks.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The guidance reminds Californians that the best defense against COVID-19 continues to be:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Staying at home and physical distancing&nbsp;</li><li>Washing hands frequently</li><li>Avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands</li><li>Avoiding being around people with COVID-19 symptoms</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The use of cloth face coverings could reduce the transmission of COVID-19 by individuals who do not have symptoms and may reinforce physical distancing.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>What is a cloth face covering?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">A cloth face covering is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">material that covers the nose and mouth</a>. It can be secured to the head with ties or straps or simply wrapped around the lower face. It can be made of a variety of materials, such as cotton, silk, or linen. A cloth face covering may be factory-made or sewn by hand, or can be improvised from household items such as scarfs, T-shirts, sweatshirts, or towels.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">H<strong>ow should I care for a cloth face covering?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It’s a good idea to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">wash your cloth face covering</a> frequently, ideally after each use. Have a bag or bin to keep cloth face coverings in until they can be laundered with detergent and hot water and dried on a hot cycle. If you must re-wear your cloth face covering before washing, wash your hands immediately after putting it back on and avoid touching your face. Discard cloth face coverings that:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>No longer cover the nose and mouth</li><li>Have stretched out or damaged ties or straps</li><li>Cannot stay on the face</li><li>Have holes or tears in the fabric</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Insurance &amp; cost</strong></h2>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong><strong>What if I don’t have health insurance and I need screening,&nbsp; testing, or treatment for COVID-19?</strong></strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The cost of coronavirus screening, testing, and treatment for the uninsured is paid for by the <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/CovidUninsuredClaim">government</a>. You can check your symptoms using the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsymptoms-testing%2Findex.html">Symptom Screener</a> or by contacting your doctor through <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/telehealth/">telehealth</a>. You can also get free <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/">testing</a> through <a href="https://www.projectbaseline.com/study/covid-19/eligibility/">Verily&#8217;s Project Baseline</a> or <a href="https://lhi.care/covidtesting">OptumServe</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>I want to get screened or tested for COVID-19. I have insurance, but what will this cost me out-of-pocket?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Nothing. The state agencies that regulate health care in California have mandated that all full-service insurance plans (including Medi-Cal) waive copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles for medically necessary screening and testing for COVID-19. This includes emergency room, urgent care, or provider office visits when the purpose of the visit is to be screened and tested for COVID-19.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">T<a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/">esting</a> for COVID-19 is covered by insurance, Medicare, and Medi-Cal. If you have no insurance, it’s paid for by the <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/CovidUninsuredClaim">government</a>. As a first step, you can check your symptoms using the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsymptoms-testing%2Findex.html">Symptom Screener</a> or by contacting your doctor through <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/telehealth/">telehealth</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>I have a concern or complaint about getting care for COVID-19 under my health insurance. What can I do?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you are having trouble accessing care, or were inappropriately charged cost-sharing for medically necessary screening and testing for COVID-19, follow up directly with your health plan by calling the member phone number listed on your health plan card. If your health plan doesn’t resolve the issue, contact the <a href="https://www.healthhelp.ca.gov/">California Department of Managed Health </a><a href="https://github.com/cagov/covid19/issues/www.HealthHelp.ca.gov">Care</a> (DMHC) Help Center for assistance at 1-888-466-2219.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>Do Medicare or Medicare Advantage Plans cover coronavirus tests or coronavirus antibody tests?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Both <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/medicare-coronavirus">Medicare</a> and <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/sign-up-change-plans/types-of-medicare-health-plans/medicare-advantage-plans">Medicare Advantage Plans</a> cover <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-tests">coronavirus tests</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-antibody-test">antibody </a>tests, with no out-of-pocket costs.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>Can I use telehealth if I am on Medicare?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Medicare has temporarily expanded its coverage of <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/telehealth">telehealth services (medical care via phone, video chat, or online portal)</a> to respond to the current Public Health Emergency. You can now use a wide range of communication tools (including smartphone) from home to interact with a range of providers, like doctors, nurse practitioners, clinical psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech language pathologists. If you have original Medicare, you can get many services without a copayment through <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/telehealth/">telehealth,</a> including evaluation and management visits (common office visits), mental health counseling, and preventive health screenings.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you have a <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/sign-up-change-plans/types-of-medicare-health-plans/medicare-advantage-plans">Medicare Advantage Plan</a>, you have access to these same benefits. Many plans offer additional <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/telehealth/">telehealth</a> benefits and expanded benefits, like meal delivery or medical transport services. Check with your plan about your coverage and costs.</p>
