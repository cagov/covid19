<h2>Your blood could save lives</h2>



<p>The antibodies of fully recovered COVID-19 patients could help fight infection in those still suffering from it. The only source of these antibodies is the blood plasma of coronavirus survivors. See this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7Ic5ej2BQ">FDA video</a> for a quick introduction.</p>



<p>Giving blood plasma to a COVID-19 patient from a person who has healed from it might help the sick person get better faster. But we need more of this plasma to find out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;The <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/">CDPH</a> sent letters to Californians who tested positive for coronavirus to encourage them to donate blood plasma.</p>



<p><strong>Your blood plasma donation could help up to 4 people suffering from COVID-19.</strong></p>



<h2>Who can donate COVID-19 plasma?</h2>



<ul><li>A person who had a test that showed coronavirus infection, <br>AND</li><li>Has felt well for at least 28 days*,<br>AND</li><li>Passes the usual rules for blood donation.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>*If you want to donate before one month has passed since you recovered, please check with your blood center. <strong>Some</strong> centers will need a negative swab test, and may have other rules.</p>



<h2>What are the risks?</h2>



<p>It is generally very safe for people to donate blood plasma. Your local blood donation center can tell you more about the risks and benefits of donation.</p>



<p>Donating is voluntary. Your decision to donate or not will not change your eligibility for medical or public health services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CDPH is not a participant or sponsor of research for COVID-19. It is supporting the work of medical providers across the state by inviting you to donate your blood plasma.</p>

<h3>Questions and answers</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Is blood plasma authorized as a COVID-19 treatment?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-issues-emergency-use-authorization-convalescent-plasma-potential-promising-covid-19-treatment">The FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)</a> for convalescent plasma to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The FDA determined that it is reasonable to believe that COVID-19 convalescent plasma may be effective in making&nbsp; COVID-19 illness shorter and less severe in some patients. The FDA also determined that the known and potential benefits of this plasma, when used to treat COVID-19, outweigh its known and potential risks. There are no adequate, approved, or available alternative treatments.</p>
