Review the details below:Shelter Network was founded in 1987 to address the growing problem of homelessness in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Most of these individuals are formerly self-sufficient members of the community: over 50% of the families served by Shelter Network have never been homeless before, and more than half of the adults are still employed when they enter Shelter Network's programs. Tragically, more than one third of the people served by Shelter Network are children, who are often most deeply affected by an episode of homelessness.

During warm months, this facility serves as transitional housing for families in need.  During cold weather months (no earlier than November and no later than the close of April), it operates solely as a cold weather shelter with opening and closing dates dependent upon weather.  As a cold weather shelter, this facility is open from 6:00pm - 8:00am, with clients asked to leave by 7:30am to allow volunteers to clean the facility; there is currently no limit to the number of nights a client may stay.  Clients are not permitted to leave and return after check-in, except to smoke in designated outdoor areas - clients must check in by 8:00pm.  Three staff members remain on site from 6pm-11pm and two staff members until 8am the following morning. Shelter clients are provided with a bed and food during their stay but are served only limited meals such as canned soup for dinner and coffee and pastries for breakfast. Clients arriving under the influence are not turned away unless they are believed to be a nuisance or pose a threat to either themselves or other clients. Clients must agree to shelter rules, including restrictions on loitering during closed hours, consumption of drugs and alcohol on site, weapons possession, etc. Clients must obtain a voucher earlier in the day to reserve a space at the cold weather shelter, and should contact Davis Community Meals at 1111 H Street for voucher information â€” vouchers are distributed on a first-come, first-served basis; alternatively Davis police officers can refer individuals to the shelter. This facility has had only one theft reported during the 2006 season, and can be considered a safe facility. For more information contact Davis Community Meals.   .. (continued)",

San Diego Business Journal article.​Emergency Shelter ProgramsShort term shelter (motel vouchers) is available for eligible domestic violence survivors and their children until other shelter options become available.​The seasonal rotational shelter program assists homeless families and individuals with 6 - 8 weeks of shelter in congregations in the East Region of San Diego County until the client can access more stable housing. Bi-weekly case management includes budgeting, employment and housing counseling to support participants in attaining permanent housing when they leave the program.​New Journey Program - Transitional HousingThis transitional housing program serves women and their children who are fleeing domestic violence. We provide safe housing in apartments that are fully furnished in confidential locations throughout San Diego County.

Crisis House supports families recovering from their trauma by providing individual and group counseling, case management, health care, food, and other crucial support services. They learn how to identify red flags in toxic relationships, provide emotional support to each other, rebuild self-esteem, and set healthy boundaries leading to creating a non-violent family unit. Women are empowered to make positive lifestyle changes to transition to a self-sufficient healthy, independent life which includes increasing income and moving to permanent housing when they leave the program.&nbsp;Journey Home and Safe Journey - Rapid Re-HousingRapid re-housing is an intervention designed to help families and individuals quickly exit homelessness and return to permanent housing.&nbsp; The goal is to support the household to eliminate barriers that impede their access to housing.&nbsp;&nbsp; These rapid-rehousing programs provide financial assistance to families and their children who are fleeing domestic violence and veteran families not eligible for SSVF services.&nbsp; Families are helped with things like security deposits, first month rent and other move in expenses so they can quickly access and retain housing.&nbsp; Case management services help participants resolve barriers to accessing their own apartment and our Housing Locator helps them find housing near work and school that is safe and affordable.&nbsp;Housing PreventionFinancial Assistance for eligible domestic violence survivors and their children to retain their current rental housing.&nbsp;Other Permanent HousingCrisis House places 95% of the families into permanent housing annual that graduate from the New Journey and the rotational shelter program.Emergency and Social ServicesDonate Now&nbsp;Program Hours/DaysMonday - Friday 8:30 am- 5:00 pm Closed for lunch 12 - 1 pm &nbsp;INFORMATION AND REFERRALResponding to immediate needs and connecting people to appropriatecommunity resources.&nbsp;ASSESSMENTAn evaluation of each client's situation is conducted in order to respond andconnect them to the appropriate services.&nbsp;CASE MANAGEMENTA case plan is developed with the client and goals and tasks are identified andmonitored to support clients toward achieving their self-sufficiency goals that empower them to renew their lives.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our service delivery model is client centered and strength based.&nbsp;JOB ASSISTANCECrisis House partners with the East County Career Center, Partnerships with Industry, Access and others to support our job ready client&rsquo;s employment goals. &nbsp;&nbsp;MEDICAL OUTREACHA mobile medical clinic operated by Family Health Centers of San Diego (FHCSD) visits our site to provide medical services and dental referrals to low income&nbsp; and homeless families and individuals.&nbsp;MENTAL HEALTH OUTREACHEast County Mental Health Clinic provides counseling and connects clients with mental health services.&nbsp;CARE - UTILITY ASSISTANCE PROGRAMCase managers help citizens who reside in East County apply for utility bill reduction through SDG&amp;E.&nbsp;LEGAL SERVICES (CIVIL)Volunteer lawyers help with legal advice.&nbsp; Call 619-444-1194 for an appointment.&nbsp;INFORMATION AND REFERRALCrisis House provides timely and accurate information and referral to services to those in crisis, connecting people to community resources.&nbsp;CalFresh (FOOD STAMPS) ENROLLMENT ASSISTANCEStaff assist eligible families and individuals enroll for this service. &nbsp;CHILDREN'S PANTRYInfant care products are provided to families with babies as part of their food package.

Review the details below:North County Interfaith Council Inc., Doing Business As Interfaith Community Services, Is A Non-Profit Organization Which Partners With More Than 350 Diverse Faith Centers In North San Diego County. Interfaith Was Formed In 1979 By A Small Group Of North County Faith Communities To Address The Growing Problems Of Poverty And Homelessness. Because The Poor Have Multiple Needs And Because Accessibility To Community Services Was A Problem, Interfaith Began Addressing Those Needs Within Its Own Service Delivery System And Through Collaborating With Other Agencies. Interfaith's Services Began At The Most Basic Level - With An Emergency Food Program. A Pantry Was Established Using Donated Food Distributed By Volunteers. But Hunger Does Not Exist In Isolation. It Is Always Linked To Other Human Conditions: Homelessness,Under- Or Non-Employment, Inadequate Parenting Skills, Physical, Emotional And Mental Illness, Illiteracy, Lack Of Education And Social Skills, Unawareness Of Available Resources, And Most Of All, Hopelessness, Loss Of Human Dignity And Spiritual Crisis. One Of The Key Strengths Of Interfaith Is That It Has Developed An Effective Community Model Approach That Propels Individuals In Need To Their Highest Level Of Self-Sufficiency And Optimum Health. Interfaith's Faith Center Members Contribute Donations Of Money, Materials, In-Kind Services, And Volunteers, Thereby Offering An Impressive Array Of Services. Interfaith Coommunity Services Has Grown From A Small Food Pantry Staffed By Volunteers To A Seamless Continuum Of Care, Which Is Operated By 90+ Paid Employees, A Board Of 20+ Community Activists, More Than 3,000 Volunteers In Direct Service, And A Membership Of More Than 350 Faith Comunities. Interfaith Has Become A National Model For Faith Community Involvement In Addressing Problems Of The Poor And The Needy. All Of Interfaith's Programs Are Designed To Help People Help Themselves, To Offer A Hand Up, Not A Handout. A Well-Designed Continuum Of Care Provides An Effective Array Of Services That Move People From Poverty And Despair To Self-Reliance And Hope... (continued)",

If he has the desire, willingness and courage to change, he is a prime candidate for the program. Upon successful completion of the New Life Discipleship Program he will have completed approximately 600 hours of structured Bible teaching, and as a result he will have developed a sound belief system.&nbsp; Men in the program are required to participate in various chores at the facility and throughout the community.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the program is one year long, he will have accomplished one year of sobriety.

Often times, even though they desire a home, they are not in a position to maintain housing.The Village provides a unique opportunity for the homeless to sleep off the streets and live in a community-type environment. The structures they live in are simple  Tuff Shed -like shelters. While in the Village there are is three simple rules,  take care of yourself, take care of others, and take care of this place.  The residents provide their own security and clean-up crew. Clients are not allowed to possess alcohol or drugs while living in the Village.

Our mission is to provide a safe, supportive environment and the resources necessary for homeless families to remain together while empowering them to become independent and self-sufficient. For most families in Orange County, homelessness was not caused by substance abuse or mental illness. You can make a positive difference and lasting impact that will enable Thomas House to provide services and support to families, such as:- Life Skills Classes: parenting, budgeting, nutrition, self-esteem development- Employment Counseling: resume, computer training, job search assistance, interview preparation, business apparel sources, ESL classes- Housing, medical &amp; dental care, transportation assistance, off-site child care- On-site individual and family counseling- Children's program: homework assistance, arts and crafts, birthday and holiday parties- Most importantly, keeping parents and children together in an environment that will provide an opportunity for a new beginning...

In 1988 Iru Moved To Missouri And On February 2, 1988 The Coordinating Board For Higher Education Granted Iru's Application To Operate Pursuant To Provisions Of Section 173.600 Through 173.618, Rsmo. October 19, 1989 The International Reform University Incorporated As A Missouri Not-For-Profit Corporation. *Until Iru's Relocation To Missouri, Iru Operated Under Section 94303(B) Of The California Education Code Before Mass Education Became Vogue, Learning Was A Creative, Far From Passive, Process. An Apprentice Studied And Practiced With A Master Under A Private Contract Between Them. A Mentor's Purpose Was Not Merely To Teach, Or Lecture, But, Also, To Guide The Learner's Steps Through The Process Of Expanding And Developing Individual Wells Of Knowledge And Awareness. The Basic Elements Of This Age-Old Form Of Learning Were: A Motivated Student, And An Ability To Question, Challenge And Formulate Personal Values, A Supportive Loving Environment, And A Community Of Similarly Dedicated Scholars. Today, A Student May Go To Any College Or University And Receive A Degree. However, Few If Any Institutions Of Higher Learning Truly Incorporate The Study Of The Divine Into Their Programs. To Study Any Subject Without Studying Its Source Cannot Provide A Full Exploration Of Any Field Of Study. This Is One Of The Key Reasons Iru Was Founded. The Founders Of Iru Understood That Without An Understanding Of The Relationship Of The Divine To A Subject Of Study Or A Student's Life That Complete Learning Was Not Taking Place. The View Of Education As Being Lacking Without A Focus On God And The Inclusion Of That Focus Is A Significant Nucleus Of The Entire Curriculum Of Iru. Every Field Of Study Is Inextricably Religious, And Only When Presented In That Context Is A Full And Complete Prospective Provided To The Student. Reactivating The Tutorial Model, Within The United States Has Been An Arduous Struggle. With Great Pride And Much Effort, The Trustees Of The International Reform University Have Developed Programs, Which Utilize The Vast Community Resources. We Take Great Satisfaction In The Knowledge That Our Graduates Have Discovered Their Power, And Are Taking Their Places As Leaders Of Change And Voices Of Critical Assessment... (continued)",

    "description": "Non Profit Organization that provides housing assistance South County Outreach has operated its Transitional Housing Program since 1994. This program is dedicated to assisting families with dependent children who have found themselves without safe housing options and need some help and guidance to get back on their feet. We operate the Transitional Housing Program through 16 condominiums owned by South County Outreach at locations throughout the cities of Lake Forest, Mission Viejo and Laguna Niguel. At any given time, there are approximately 37 adults and 66 children residing in our units. The average length of stay is 6-9 months depending upon the family&rsquo;s need and their progress. The goal of the program is that each family becomes self-sufficient and secures permanent housing.Program StructureAfter being screened for eligibility and accepted into the program, families are assigned to a case manager and partner throughout their time in the Transitional Housing Program. An individualized plan is developed with each participant based on the needs of the family. Mandatory weekly meetings monitor and evaluate the family&rsquo;s progress and weekly life-skills workshops provide the participants with the necessary tools to become self-sufficient. In conjunction with their case manager, each participant learns to create and stick to a livable budget. In addition, each family sets up a savings program through South County Outreach to save up to 25% of their income each month to be applied toward permanent housing at the end of their program. Each family pays rent, not to exceed 30% of their income, and pays a security deposit.South County Outreach also works with other non-profits and contracts with various experts to provide a comprehensive list of services, including:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weekly case management meeting&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Career coaching and apparel vouchers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; South County Outreach computer training / computer donations&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consumer credit counseling&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parenting skills workshops&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nutritional food, groceries and cleaning supplies&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Program participants may continue to participate in a number of services after they move into permanent housingApplicationsApplications can be picked up at the office or downloaded.

Our Philosophy:Friends Helping Friends LA takes a unique approach to addressing the plight of homelessness by providing a home-like environment to those who would otherwise be homeless.We are significantly different from a homeless shelter because rather than having a warehouse full of cots, we house our clients in single family homes with all the amenities that typically come with living in a house&mdash;comfortable furnishings, the ability to cook/prepare your own food, the comfort and security of personal, private space and most importantly a family environment. While shelters provide a much needed service, they are only temporary fixes to a much broader problem.At Friends Helping Friends we believe that the only way to truly break the cycle of homelessness is to give people hope of a better tomorrow. While our service falls under the title of &ldquo;transitional housing,&rdquo; we are much more than that. We not only provide the basic human necessities to survive, but also the love, support and resources necessary to move toward safe and permanent housing. cases, homelessness is a direct result of substance abuse so we encourage all our residents to be proactive in their recovery from drugs and alcohol and address their specific needs and problems, building on their strengths and tapping into inner resources.At Friends Helping Friends we know that chemical dependency is a serious disease, therefore, in addition to providing housing, another primary goal is to help residents focus on recovery as a way of life.The Friends Helping Friends sober community works together to create an environment of growth, support and accountability.We stress that lasting sobriety requires a transformation in attitude and outlook on life...

Review the details below:PATH was founded in 1984 by a community collaborative of churches, synagogues, businesses, and concerned citizens who came together to address the growing problem of homelessness in Los Angeles. The group became incorporated as a non-profit organization with the mission ?to break the cycle of homelessness by empowering people with the tools for self-sufficiency. Our approach is to help people find work, save money, secure housing, and empower their lives. Based on the belief that the homeless need  a hand up, not a hand out,  PATH's programs respond to the immediate food and shelter needs of homeless people, as well as their long-term needs for financial security and stable housing. We are revolutionizing the way communities approach homeless services through our Regional Homeless Center, which opened in 2002 and brings together 98 beds of transitional housing with our innovative PATHMall collaborative. Through the PATHMall, homeless individuals gain access to over 20 supportive services in one convenient location. The PATHMall has received national recognition from ABC World News Tonight, British Broadcasting Corporation and the 2003 Mutual of America Community Partnership Award for being an effective model for serving the homeless. Each year, we serve over 4,500 homeless men, women and children. More information on PATH can be found at www.epath.org. Fees may apply for this Transitional Housing resource.

Seniors, Disabled, Or Families ? So They Can Live Independently In Warmth And Safety.Rtp Organizes And Trains Volunteers To Repair Homes And Community Facilities Of Neighbors In Need. This Effort Culminates In ?National Rebuilding Day?, Held The Last Saturday In April, In Which Over 70 Homes And Community Facilities Receive Much Needed Maintenance Services. Rtp Serves All Of San Mateo County And Northern Santa Clara County, An Area With A Total Population Of Over 1 Million. Our Efforts Are Strengthened By Partnerships And Collaborations With Government Agencies, Private Businesses, Skilled Craftspeople, Civic Organizations, Churches And Community Volunteers. Every Year, Rtp Brings Thousands Of Volunteers And Corporate Sponsors Together To Preserve Affordable Housing And Rebuild Communities. It?S People Helping People, Neighbor Helping Neighbor, Enhancing Dignity And Pride For All Who Participate.Over 51,000 LowIncome Homeowners Live In The Peninsula Communities We Serve. In 2008, We Received 262 Applications But Could Only Accept 76 Projects. The Average Annual Income Of Our Recipients Under $26,000. The Need Is Clear. Many Neighbors Have Worked Hard All Their Lives And Have Been Physically And Financially Able To Repair Their Homes For Most Of That Time. Now Due To Illness, Aging, Inflation Or Job Loss, They Are Unable To Fund This Work On Their Own And Their Homes Have Deteriorated. Each Homeowner Has His Or Her Own Story, But One Theme Is Constant: Neighbors On Fixed Incomes Are Being Forced Out Of Their Homes Or Are Making Agonizing Decisions To Forgo Even Basic Home Maintenance. The Result Is Unsafe Conditions, A Loss Of The Homeowner?S Dignity And Crumbling Neighborhoods. Rebuilding Together Peninsula Eliminates These Hardships For Our Recipients. One Day Of Volunteer Effort Does Make A Difference In People?S Lives. Home Ownership Is An Investment In An Individual?S Future. Rtp Provides Individuals With Opportunities To Invest In The Future Of Our Communities... (continued)",

With so many charities asking for help, we know it is sometimes hard to decide where to send your hard-earned donations. All we ask is this &ndash; please visit our website and notice our performance awards and amazing TV coverage including our prestigious 10News Leadership Award. We hope you agree &ndash; awards and coverage of this magnitude come only from genuine and effective service &ndash; actually accomplishing what you promised to do!We assist homeless or at-risk individuals and their children. The mission of The Trinity House, is &ldquo;to provide transitional housing in San Diego to underserved individuals and families in need, and to coordinate successful re-integration of residents into the community by promoting a positive transformation of their lives.&rdquo; The Trinity House is an essential part of San Diego's solution to homelessness - we fill a unique and vital niche by offering a specialized service that focuses on helping clients become self-sufficient.The core program of The Trinity House, Path to Self-Sufficiency (PSS) provides case management services to residents to help them set and achieve goals. The PSS program is a client-driven process whereby residents, with the help of a Case Manager (CM), determine benchmarks and milestones of progress they work toward during their time at The Trinity House. When a client enters one of our homes, he or she goes through the PSS process with their CM to assess their immediate needs, create a budget, develop daily lists of tasks to complete, and set goals. The CM works closely with the client advocating for their needs, periodically reviewing their goals, and redirecting their efforts when necessary to ensure client success. In addition to the services previously outlined, through the PSS program clients receive assistance with service fee subsidies, transportation support, and necessity assistance (i.e. food, toiletries, healthcare).Path to Self-Sufficiency-Transitions (PSST) is an offshoot of the PSS program designed specifically for transition-aged foster youth. The PSS Program provide services such as employment assistance, educational assistance, transportation assistance, rent subsidies, program service fees, and various other expenses of necessity. These services, along with our proven array of empowerment programs, aim to assist at-risk former foster youth from plummeting into a cycle of homelessness. Given that approximately 250 former fosteryouth in San Diego transition each year, the services offered by the PSST program are vital... (continued)",

Clients meet individually with counselors to discuss mental health, substance abuse, and transition issues.&nbsp; They also participate in clinical and psycho-educational groups twice daily.&nbsp; Clinical interventions include Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), and Motivational Interviewing (MI).&nbsp; Clients have an opportunity to meet with the psychiatrists on staff and receive medication education and services from the nursing staff...

There is no discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, age, language, disability, religion, national origin, medical condition, marital status, veteran status, or sexual orientation.Services &amp; Programs for Domestic violence victimsEmergency ShelterThe prospect of homelessness for a victim of domestic violence is often the major contributing factor in deciding to remain in a violent relationship. House of Ruth's emergency shelter provides programs and support for victims and their children, including food, clothing, personal care items, group and individual counseling, legal and social services advocacy, employment assistance, and life-management skills. The shelter is staffed 24-hours a day, 7 days a week.Transitional Living ProgramHouse of Ruth's transitional shelter provides residence, case management and other services free of charge for up to two years. Residents are required to save 30% of their income in order to attain permanent housing, purchase a car or furniture, or pursue educational goals after leaving the program. The program addresses the longer-term needs of survivors and their children, providing the opportunity to work toward their goals of independent, non-violent homes.Children's ProgramsA five-day-a-week program assists children in both the emergency and transitional shelters to reduce the trauma and self-blame they experience from witnessing domestic violence or as victims themselves. Advocates help children explore their feelings, learn alternatives to violence and constructively manage their anger. School-aged children are able to continue their education through the school district at which they attend.Child Abuse Treatment ProgramThe Child Abuse Treatment Program (CHAT) provides no-cost counseling and case management services to children from 4 to 18 years of age who have experienced abuse, neglect or violence in their homes, schools or communities.

Review the details below:The transition from adolescence to adulthood is a difficult transition, even with an intact family structure. Recent studies have shown that the average young person must rely on parental support during this transitional period, and do not actually become self-sufficient until age 26. By contrast, youth exiting the foster care systems do not have this option; they are cut off from their sole support system at age 18. Where most teens are entering this time of their life with a sense of awe and opportunity, foster kids are left in a state of desperation. Without a home to return to, they often sleep on couches, in cars or turn themselves in to the local homeless shelter. For these kids the future is bleak.Our mission is to provide teens with housing, life sustaining higher education and access back to services.To dramatically impact statistics in regards to homelessness, education and mental health outcomes for this population.

If an individual does not have a source of income, we develop a plan together to get them stable income. This is usually where they have the option of our Work Search Program, but can also mean a referral to the Veterans Resource Center, the Social Security Office, Employment Development Department, or Cal-Works if they have children. Once an income is acquired that is able to sustain them once they leave here, our guests have the opportunity to be a part of our money savings program. They are able to save money for a few months while receiving shelter at the Mission to build up their savings for a security deposit and necessary housing expenses.The Mission also provides long term shelter for men and women who are enrolled in our long term recovery program. Our students live on site for 13 months during the first four phases of their individualized program.Transitional HousingWe have many agencies that we refer our guests to, including multiple transitional housing facilities to meet various needs.

Our social workers also assist with housing navigation, important because in our housing market, homeless people with no credit or bad credit are often non-competitive for apartment rental. Social workers assist with health needs (referrals to Whole Person Care and health providers) and income enhancement through employment or through acquisition of government benefits if the client is disabled.

Review the details below:Our Mission Is To Support The Independence And Well Being Of Seniors. Studies Indicate That Proper Nutrition Is Vital To Healthy Aging And Aids In Recovery From Illness And Injury. Approximately Eighty-Five Percent Of Older Americans Suffer From Chronic Illnesses And Disabilities That Could Be Aided By Maintaining A Nutritionally Balanced Diet. Meals-On-Wheels Offers Consistent Delivery Of Nutritionally Balanced Meals. Meals-On-Wheels Is The Only Organization In The Area Home-Delivering Two Meals A Day, For Seven Days A Week (Including Holidays), And Providing Modified Diets, To Seniors, Age 60 And Older, Throughout San Diego County. Meals Are Specially Formulated For Senior Nutrition Using Area Agency On Aging Nutrition Center Guidelines. Diabetic, Reduced Fat/Reduced Sodium, Easy To Chew And General Meals Are Available Diet Options. Meals Are Also Available For Delivery To Seniors Needing Short-Term Assistance, Such As Those Recovering From Outpatient Surgery. Although Seniors Do Pay A Maximum Fee Of $7.00 Per Day For The Delivery Of Two Meals, The Fees Do Not Cover Meals-On-Wheels' Costs To Provide The Meals. The Full Cost Of Our Program Is Subsidized For 100% Of Our Seniors, Most Of Whom Are Challenged By Living On A Fixed Income. Because We Believe That Food Is One Of Life?S Most Basic Necessities And No One Should Ever Have To Go Hungry, Fees May Be Further Reduced For Seniors Who Are Unable To Afford $7.00 Per Day. More And More, As They Find Themselves Faced With Difficult Financial Decisions, Seniors Are Turning To Meals-On-Wheels For Help. The Average Age Of A Meals-On-Wheels Recipient Is 80 And About 84% Are Considered LowIncome. Rising Housing And Energy Costs, In Addition To Escalating Prescription Medication Charges, Impact Their Already Limited Income. Combine These Factors With A Declining Ability To Physically Care For Themselves And Pension Checks That Are Insufficient To Cover Basic Household Expenses, And It's Easy To See Why Many Seniors Struggle To Remain In Their Homes...

Review the details below:With The Largest Urban Indian Population In The Country, American Indians In Los Angeles County Face Severe Economic Challenges. This Includes A Dispersed Residential Pattern, Chronic Poverty And A Lack Of Reliable Access To Educational, Developmental And Outreach Services. In Addition, On Average, A Full Time/Full Year American Indian Employee Earns Approximately 40% Less Than A Non-Hispanic White Counterpart, Increasing The Chances For A Crisis To Push That Person Below The Poverty Line.To Address This Situation, Pukuu, Cultural Community Services, Co-Funded By Community Partners And A Los Angeles County Community Services Block Grant, Created The One Stop Emergency Service Center (Oses). This Center Currently Offers Intervention To Clients In The Form Of Temporary Aid. In Addition, The Center Has Employment Education And Training Programs To Facilitate Self-Sufficiency For The Beneficiary. This Grant Allowed For An Improved Infrastructure And Outreach Program That Lead To The Non-Profit To More Than Double Their Previous Service Base. Field Managers, Outreach Specialists And Other Temporary Personnel, Along With The Rental Of A Larger Office Space Provided A Vital Role For Making This Program Lasting And Sustainable, With An Immediate Direct Impact On The Needs Of Its Beneficiaries.Through Its Programs And Intended Expansion, The Center Promotes Three Direct Areas Of Impact. First, It Prevents Clients On The Threshold Of Poverty From Slipping Into Need Due To An Unforeseen Or Unintended Crisis. Second, It Takes Beneficiaries Already In Poverty And Gives Them Access To Employment Education And Training Programs That Transition Them Out Of Their Current Situation. Finally, The Program Strengthens Cultural Ties Throughout The American Indian Community Of Los Angeles, Creating Self-Actuated Support Networks That Reduce Reliance On Federal And State Resources...

Review the details below:Research Shows That Employment Is A Chief  Trigger  In Aiding Those With The Greatest Barriers To Work In Their Transition From Poverty To Productivity And Greater Prosperity. Nearly Three-Fourths Of Poverty Spells End With A Rise In Earnings And Employment Occurs Twice As Frequently As Any Other Event Associated With An Exit From Poverty. Employment Also Encourages Social Mobility In Addition To Providing An Economic Benefit. A Job Strengthens Human Capital, Facilitates Access To Financial Capital, Builds Interpersonal Skills, And Enhances Social Networks. Having A Job Boosts Employees' Self-Confidence And Is Source Of Dignity And Pride.But Entering And Staying In The Workforce Is Extremely Difficult For Many People Who Live In Protracted Poverty And Have Also Confronted Homelessness, Health Problems, Fragmented Families, Incarceration, And Inadequate Access To A Good Education. The Private Sector Is Often Unwilling To Hire Employees Facing These Barriers Or Provide Adequate Support To Address The Many Challenges That Can Undermine Their Success Once On The Job.Few Workforce Development Programs Have Achieved Positive Outcomes Preparing Those Workers That Are Most Disconnected To Jobs, Or Creating Durable Pathways To Employment. Mdrc, One Of The Premiere Researchers In This Area, Summarizes This Consensus:  For At Least Three Decades, Policymakers, Researchers, And Program Operators Have Developed And Studied Strategies To Help People Who Face Serious Obstacles To Steady Work. Despite The Broad Policy Interest In Serving The Hard-To-Employ, Knowledge About Effective Program Strategies Is Still Relatively Undeveloped. Redf Is Uniquely Positioned To Address This Problem. Our Successful Track Record Of Building The Capacity Of Nonprofits To Operate Social Enterprises And The Success Those Businesses Have Demonstrated In Employing, Retaining And Advancing Their Employees Is A Solid Foundation To Build On As We Invest In Our New Portfolio And Expand The Role We Play With The Organizations That We Intensely Supported For Many Years...

Once in permanent housing, families build on their success with aftercare support from our programs staff and expansive network of community partners.Our goal is to ensure that families feel secure and supported, and that all school-age youth in our programs are attending school. In addition to 21 one-bedroom units, families also have access to common areas including a playground, laundry room, garden, and library, as well as an on-site food pantry and a  thrift store . Parents and their children enjoy enrichment activities throughout their time with us, including tutoring, life skills and holiday events.Emergency ShelterUpward Bound House provides families in crisis with short-term emergency shelter on the Westside and in South Los Angeles.Throughout their time in shelter, children and their parents are provided with daily grab-and-go breakfasts and hot evening meals, as well as clothing and household items as needed. While in a safe and comfortable living space with their children, parents work with our case managers, housing locators and employment specialists to achieve stability and independence for their families. We help move families into permanent housing and connect them with our vast network of community partners while also continuing to support their growth with aftercare services that we provide.Rapid RehousingUpward Bound House's Rapid Rehousing program works to help the growing population of families in South Los Angeles who are experiencing homelessness.Using the Housing First model, we move families into permanent affordable housing as quickly as possible, assist with move-in costs such as security and utility deposits and short-medium term declining rental subsidies, and provide intensive social services while families are in their own homes. These supportive services are designed to enhance each family's stability and equip them with the skills and resources they need to sustain and thrive in housing and avoid future homelessness.Once a family is housed, Upward Bound House works with over 20 community-based organizations to provide additional supportive services to increase their income, help them escape poverty, and improve the health, education and development of their young children.&nbsp;..

These services have been provided through our Basic Needs Food and Clothing Programs. These programs provide the following: sack lunch, mail service, and clothing closet, transportation and resource referrals. As much needed and important as these programs are, alone they do not adequately address our homeless clients becoming housed and attaining their highest quality of life.We have found through our years of assisting homeless people that without one-on-one advocacy and assistance, a homeless individual&rsquo;s chance of obtaining and retaining housing is almost zero. As a result, LSS has implemented a best-practices street outreach and case management program that assists clients in securing housing and navigating county resources. This program, Homeless 2 Home (H2H), will incorporate our basic needs programs with case management (working one-on-one with our homeless population), and street outreach as needed to assist our clients with the transition from homelessness to the security of a home.LSS recognized the need and value of the H2H program in 2012 and implemented it in East Ventura County. Currently, LSS collaborates with four other agencies all operating the H2H program. In the first half of 2014 the LSS H2H program has housed over 25 homeless individuals and families in the east end of the Ventura County.As of July 2014, LSS has implemented the H2H Program in Van Nuys. A case manager is available for working with homeless individuals and families in the North Los Angeles area. LSS will be focusing its efforts on the chronically homeless population which has been identified as being the least served and the most at risk of premature death... (continued)",

Established in 1985 and expanding services into our new facility in 2006 at Fourth and Hope, individuals and families in crisis come to the Emergency Shelter to identify their needs and be connected to appropriate resources.Family Transitional ProgramThe Family Transitional Housing Program has provided the security of shelter and support services to more than 2000 children and their parents since being established in 1989. These families receive intensive case management services beginning with an extensive assessment to analyze the family's history and events leading up to the current state of homelessness. The goal is to address the identified issues, enhance parenting and life skills, assist the family in securing economic independence through employment or other benefits programs and ultimately, have permanent housing secured. Due to the incredible need for housing, the organization has expanded its housing program to include single individuals, including Veterans, and the mentally ill who would have otherwise remained homeless. By developing partnerships with property managers and property owners, we have reduced barriers to accessing housing and increased our housing units from 12 to 55 (an increase of 458%) in less than 2 years. This emphasizes our commitment to reducing homelessness in our community and throughout Yolo County.TreatmentWalter's HouseWalter's House operates a Therapeutic Community Model which helps clients begin to understand how their decisions and behaviors effect everyone around them which addresses distorted thinking patterns and low self-opinion and allows clients to experience recovery from addictive behaviors.
